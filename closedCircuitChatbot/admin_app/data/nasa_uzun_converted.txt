xiiSummary
This final report covers work performed on Phase I, task 1 of the
Advanced Composites Structural Concepts and Materials Technologies for
Primary Structures contract which is part of the NASA-ACT program. The
focus of this task was to develop advanced composite wing and fuselage
concepts using emerging technologies in order to reduce overall costs.
In subtask 1, "Initial Assessment/Ranking", four wing and three
fuselage design/manufacturing concepts were developed that had the
potential to meet the program cost and weight goals. The wing concepts
are labeled: modular; resin transfer molded; automatic tow placed and
braided. The fuselage concepts are labeled: sandwich; geodesic and
stiffened shell. Through the development process it was determined that
braiding of an entire wing structure was not practical with current or
near term braiding equipment and was therefore dropped from further
consideration. The remaining wing and fuselage concepts were developed
in sufficient detail to provide cost and weight data. Design details such
as, cutouts, taper effects and joints were not addressed in this subtask,
but were to be addressed in subtask 2, "Structural Concept Development".
Trade studies were conducted to compare the cost and weight of each
concept to the baseline data. As part of the trade studies, each concept
was evaluated by experts in the various fields to provide a subjective
analysis to assist in the down selection process. Trade study results
were used to select which concept to carry forward into the detail design
subtask. Therefore, the automatic tow placed wing and the stiffened shell
fuselage concepts were taken into the detail design subtask for further
development.
Early during the detail design subtask, the NASA Steering Committee
recommended that the ACT programs focus in resin transfer molding,
automated fiber placement and textiles structures. Therefore, subtask 2
was terminated and Lockheed efforts were redirected to textile
structures development.
xiii1.0 Introduction
The use of graphite/epoxy for conventional medium primary and
secondary structures has been demonstrated to save weight compared to
conventional metal structures and to meet all the strength,stiffness and
durability requirements of transport aircraft in commercial airline
service. This is also true for military transport aircraft. However, the full
potential of these composite materials has not yet been realized,
primarily because cost savings have not been demonstrated in conjunction
with efficient structural concepts.
The Advanced Composite Technology (ACT) Program was initiated to
provide creative research on new and innovative structural concepts, in
particular concepts for wing and fuselage primary structures, to achieve
this potential for future transcentury aircraft. The new structural
concepts are to take advantage of improved organic matrix materials and
new and emerging fabrication techniques. The validated structures
technology being developed under the ACT program is necessary to provide
the confidence essential for the use of composite materials for future
primary aircraft structures.
The Lockheed contract consists of two phases. Phase I, Evaluation
and Initial Development, was initiated in May, 1989 and ran through May of
1992. Phase II, Development and Verification of Technology, was initiated
in October 1991 and is scheduled to run through April 1995. The total
program extends over 72 months.
Phase I consisted of five tasks: Task 1, Design/Manufacturing
Concept Assessment; Task 2, Structural Response and Failure Analysis;
Task 3, Advanced Material Concepts; Task 4, Assessment Review; and Task
5, Composite Transport Wing Technology Development.
Phase II consists of four tasks: Task 1, Advanced Resin Systems for
Textile Technology; Task 2, Preform Development and Processing; Task 3,
Design, Analysis, Fabrication and Test; and Task 4, Low-Cost Fabrication
Development. The program master schedule is shown in Figure 1.
Phase I has been completed and Final Reports are published for Tasks
1, 2 and 3. Task 4 was an assessment of Phase I results and the plans for1989 i 1990 1991 1992

32.0 Preliminary Design Trade Studies
2.1 Baseline Wing And Fuselage
The baseline aircraft selected for this study was the Lockheed
Tristar L-1011 commercial transport aircraft. This baseline was
selected because of the extensive loads, cost and weights data available.
The L-1011 is a modern design representing current aluminum design
technology and manufacturing methodology.
Baseline Wing
The L-1011 baseline wing design, shown in Figure 2, is a swept and
tapered wing approximately 1000 inches long. The upper surface skin has
a splice and "Z" section spanwise stiffeners. The lower surface is
continuous with "J" section stiffeners. Typical rib spacing is 26 inches.
All components are mechanically joined by conventional methods to form
the wing assembly. Loads and design criteria were taken from OWS
151.10 and are discussed in detail in Section 2.2.
Baseline Fuselaae
The L-1011 baseline fuselage is shown in Figure 3 and composed of
stiffened skins, circumferential frames and passenger cabin floor
structure. For this study, the cabin floor structure was omitted. Efforts
were focused on the development of the fuselage shell structure with
loads and design criteria taken form FS 750.00, these are discussed in
detail in Section 2.3.
2.2 Design Studies Of Wing Conce.Dts
In the subtask of Task 1, "Initial Assessment/Ranking", several
wing design concepts were developed using emerging technologies in an
attempt to achieve the program goals. These were, resin transfer molding
(RTM) of large assemblies, modular, automated tow placement (ATP) and
braiding. Within each concept different structural options, such as,
different stiffener configurations, integral or separate spars, were
evaluated before arriving at the final configurations. These will be

enough detail to perform cost and weight analyses, but omitted design
details such as, joints, cutouts and taper effects. Although these items
may be major cost and weight drivers they were omitted from the "Initial
Assessment/Ranking" subtask, but were addressed later in the Structural
Concept Development subtask, see Section 3.0. All of the concepts were
developed to a similar level of detail to provide for a meaningful
comparison. The wing concepts are labeled ATP, Braided, Modular and RTM,
representing the basic manufacturing approach for that concept, although
the Modular concept was not restricted to any one particular
manufacturing approach.
In developing the concepts no restrictions were placed on the choice
of material/material form, process or structural arrangement. The
designs started with the "blank sheet" approach. Both thermoset and
thermoplastic materials were acceptable and all material forms were
considered for the various applications. However, the cost issue generally
drove the materials selection away from thermoplastics and toward
thermosets. Emphasis was placed on automated and/or out-of-autoclave
processes to reduce hand labor and manufacturing costs. Tooling
requirements were considered but the emphasis was on reducing recurring
costs, with tooling costs being amortized over a production run.
The concepts were developed using the Design/Manufacturing
Integration (DIM I) team approach. In order to develop the designs in a
timely and efficient manner all engineering disciplines (design, stress,
manufacturing, producibility, materials and processes, and quality) were
involved early in the design cycle, and throughout the design phase
actually drove the concepts to their final design configurations. Each
engineering discipline provided inputs into the designs to ensure that they
were viable, producible and supportable.
The DIM I team developed design packages that consisted of concept
drawings, a material selection list, a manufacturing plan and a quality
assurance plan. Completed design packages were then submitted to cost
and weights for analysis. Estimated costs and weights were then
compared to the baseline cost and weights to determine which concept
best satisfied the program goals, see Section 2.7.
7Wing Stress Analysis
A Structural Sizing Trade Study was conducted to support the
evaluation of four composite wing box concepts. The sizing effort
involved determining, for each concept, the optimum (minimum weight)
dimensions of the wing covers, ribs and spars so that a weight comparison
could be made on the basis of an entire wing box cross section.
The four wing box concepts considered in the trade study are:
IÂ° Filament wound with integral blade stiffeners.
II. Resin Transfer Molded with integral stiffeners.
III. Modular design consisting of an automated fiber
placement skin, stiffened by co-bonded pultruded blade
stiffeners, filament wound spars and press formed ribs.
IV. Braided with integral "Hat" stiffeners.
The design criteria for sizing each of the wing concepts is
summarized in the Table 1. The design loads shown are upper cover loads
taken from the L-1011 wing box analysis. Specifically, the internal loads
used were at outer wing station (OWS) 151.0 and result from a 1.33 g
aileron roll condition.
The optimum cover cross section was determined by conducting a
parametric study in which the three stiffener cross sections were
analyzed with varying stiffener spacing, rib spacing and skin laminate
types. The parametric analyses are summarized in Table 2. For each
stiffener type and spacing considered, an o_)timum set of detail
dimensions for the the flange widths and thicknesses was calculated
using the PASCO program.
PASCO is a NASA developed program for analysis of stiffened panel
structures for any combination of in-plane loads, pressure and edge
moments. The program, which models a structure with linked plate
elements, also has the capability to account for initial (bow type)
imperfections. PASCO consists of a buckling analysis program (VlPASA),
8a non-linear mathematical programming optimizer (CONMIN) and material
failure analysis capability. The optimizer has the added capability of
allowing constraints on the dimensions in order to avoid an impractical
design solution. The ability of this program to rapidly model and optimize
a structure for a variety of load conditions and design constraints made it
particularly useful in this trade study.

3. Design Standards
The conditions in Table 2 are defined as follows:
1. Unrestricted - The PASCO program will provide an optimum
configuration without consideration of laminate design standards
such as maintaining a minimum percentage of plies in any
9direction, damage tolerance requirements, or even number of
plies. Laminate symmetry will be enforced.
2. Soft Skin - The PASCO model will be constrained to force a
minimum of 50% + 45 degree plies. All other conditions are as
outlined above.
3. Design Standards - The PASCO solution will be modified to
maintain a minimum of 8% 90 degree plies. Stiffeners will have
no more than 60% 0 degree plies, skins will have a minimum of
50% + 45 degree plies. An even number of plies will be
maintained.
A wing upper cover with initial eccentricity, which is subjected to
lateral pressure while loaded in axial compression is sensitive to the
ratio of applied load to critical buckling load. At load ratios (Pa/ Pc r)
above .67, the deflections and moments become excessively amplified. For
this reason, a factor of 1.5 will be applied to the ultimate compression
load for stability analysis. In other words, the panel will be sized to
ultimate load for strength; but to 1.5 times ultimate for stability. This
approach to preventing general instability and reducing deflections was
outlined in the Composite Transport Wing Technology Development
Program (contract NAS1-17699).
The specified minimum Gt in Table 1 represents a typical value for
the L-1011 wing. Maintaining this minimum Gt will ensure satisfaction of
dynamic requirements, and thereby increase the validity of the predicted
weight savings relative to the baseline structure.
The mechanical properties used in this preliminary sizing study
were for an IM7/HTA thermoplastic:
El-t -- 25.5MSI
El-c = 20.5MSI
E2 -- 1.35 MSl
G12 -- 0.65MSI
10Vl 2 = 0.36
p = 0.059 Ib/in 3
After the parametric studies of the three structural concepts were
completed, the upper cover of the RTM concept was re-sized using
properties for an AS-4/toughened epoxy material system. The resulting
panel configuration was approximately 12% heavier than the IM-7 cover.
The results of the parametric analyses are given in Tables 3 and 4.
Table 3 contains results for conditions 1 and 2 together because in most
instances, the results for both conditions were the same. Where they are
different, two entries are made in the table. Note that for the condition 3
analysis, the hat stiffened (braided) concept was not included. The
braided concept was eliminated because it would have exceeded the size
limitations of existing and projected braiding machinery.
In order to make a more valid weight comparison between the cover
concepts, an estimate was made of the rib areal weight for each rib
spacing, and added to the cover areal weight. The weight of the wing
covers alone decreases with decreasing rib spacing; so, without
accounting for the associated increase in rib weight, a true optimum
spacing cannot be determined. The optimum (minimum weight) spacing
can be determined from the plot of areal weight vs. rib spacing shown in
Figures 4 and 5. The tabular results for the total weight of ribs and
covers is given in Tables 5 and 6
Based upon the results from the upper cover compression panel
study, and from manufacturing considerations, the optimum blade
stiffener spacing was determined to be 6.17 inches. The PASCO optimized
panel cross section is shown in Figure 6.
1.2.1 Modular Wina
The modular wing concept, in contrast to the other wing concepts,
featured discrete upper and lower covers with no spanwise or chordwise
joints, separate spars and rib components which were to be subsequently

mechanically assembled, see Figure 7. This design approach kept the size
of individual components within manageable proportions and allowed a
variety of low-cost fabrication methods to be utilized. The cost benefits
achieved through the use of large one-piece components and optimal
fabrication methods was sufficient to offset additional assembly costs.
To futher help reduce costs automated manufacturing techniques were
selected wherever possible.
The upper and lower covers were designed with continuous blade
stiffeners running along the entire span of the wing. Two other stiffener
configurations were considered, namely 'J' and 'Hat' sections. With these
stiffener configurations the stiffener spacing could have been increased
(decreasing the total number of stiffeners required), but the added
complexity in manufacturing and assembly was not cost effective. One of
the concerns with composite stiffened skin designs is the peeling or
separation of the stiffener from the skin under load, particularly for post-
buckled structures. The concept, shown in Figure 8, resolved that concern
by embedding the base flanges of the stiffener within the skin laminate,
which provides a mechanical lock of the stiffeners in addition to the
bonded joint.

Figure 7, Modular Wing Concept.
Figure 8, Embedded Stiffener Configuration For Modular Wing Concept.
16In keeping with the design philosophy of minimizing the use of
fasteners, the rib caps and shear ties would be co-cured with the covers,
see Figure 9. The rib caps are 'mouse holed' at the stringer intersection
to allow for the continuous stiffeners. Another feature of the rib caps is
the integral shear ties to the stringers made by folding the mouse hole
material to form a 'clip' instead of cutting the mouse hole material away.
The rib web which was used to carry the crushing/tension/shear loads, is
a hat stiffened web with flanges formed at the front and rear for
attachment to the spars. Also included in the rib design is a flange at the
top and bottom to form the rib chords. The rib chords are required because
the rib caps had cut outs and does not provide adequate stability. The
front and rear spars are '1' section beams with co-bonded blade stiffeners
and are mechanically attached to the skin. Mechanical attachment is
necessary for the final assembly of the wing components. Figure 10
shows the overall configuration of the spars and rib webs.

17Figure 10, Spars And Rib Web Configuration.
The manufacturing plan for the upper and lower covers includes co-
curing of continuous stiffeners with the base embedded into the skins.
Multi-axial stitched preforms and resin film infusion (RFI) were chosen
for stiffener fabrication. In the RFI process, resin film is melted into dry
performs. The preform can then be inserted into an integrally heated tool
for final part fabrication in a pressure vesseT. Use of a pressure vessel is
an inexpensive way to apply pressure and fabricate parts. The stiffeners
are fully cured and co-bonded to the skins. Manufacture of rib caps is to
be accomplished by oven molding form prepreg. Rib caps are to be
advanced to an advanced B-stage to allow for subsequent co-cure within
the cover assembly. The skin subassembly is produced by inserting the rib
cap performs into recesses of the skin tool and laying an initial plyset (by
automatic tape laying or hand lay-up) of the skin material. Cured
18stringers are then located and the remaining skin plies automatic tape
laid. This assembly is then conventionally bagged and cured in an
autoclave.
Manufacture of the spars includes the use of pultruded blade
stiffeners and 'C' section preforms made by automated tow placement.
Pultruded stiffeners are placed into recesses of the tool which are then
used as a mandrel for automated tow placement, as illustrated in Figure
11. This assembly is subsequently split along the length to produce two
'C' sections. The sections are placed back-to-back to form the '1' beam
with canted flanges and co-cured in an autoclave. The rib webs are the
only thermoplastic parts in the modular wing concept and were designed
to be press formed/compression molded from a flat plyset and then
waterjet cut to shape.
A summary of the materials chosen for each component along with
the manufacturing method are shown below in Table 7.

2.2.2 Resin Transfer Molded Wina
In order to reduce costs the resin transfer molded (RTM) wing
concept was originally conceived as a one piece wing with no spanwise or
chordwise joints. Due to the manufacturing complexity however, this
basic approach was changed to a two piece wing box with spanwise
splices in the spar webs. This resulted in two major subassemblies; the
lower cover/spar web and the upper cover/spar cap, which are then joined
20through rib webs. Resin transfer molding was selected as the preferred
manufacturing method for the upper and lower cover subassemblies.
The upper cover, shown in Figure 12, included continuous blade
stiffeners similar to the Modular wing concept, except that the stiffeners
are stitched to the cover to resist the peel loads/effects. Stitching was
chosen to reinforce the joint because embedding the stiffener within the
skin laminate was not deemed practical in this application. In addition,
the base flanges of the stiffeners are feathered to reduce the loads at the
free edges, see Figure 13. Before selecting the blade stiffener
configuration, hat stiffeners were also considered. However, they were
eliminated because of the added tooling risks/complexity of having to
remove the long (and possibly entrapped) mandrel required to form the hat
cross-section.
Figure 12, Upper Cover With Integral Spar Cap.
Integral spar caps are an added feature of the RTM wing concept.
The spar caps were added to the cover subassembly to reduce final
It
assembly costs and also to greatly minimize fuel sealing requirements.
should be noted that while adding these features increases tooling
21complexity and tool costs they reduce subsequent recurring assembly
costs, one of the main cost drivers. This points out one of the risk areas
of the RTM concept. Although resin transfer molding has been shown to be
a low-cost, reliable manufacturing approach for small parts/assemblies,
its use in very large structures has not been verified and "scale-up" is a
major concern.
STITCHED
Figure 13, RTM Wing Concept Stiffener Configuration.
The lower cover, see Figure 14, is similar to the upper cover but
takes the idea of combining components one step further in that it has
integral spar webs in addition to the spar cap. The spar web is basically
an extension of the spar cap vertical flange. Both covers also have
integral "mouse holed" rib caps with shear ties to the stiffeners. "Mouse
holing" of the rib caps allows the blade stiffeners to be continuous,
eliminating joints. Rib attachment flanges are also included in the front
and rear spars to complete attachment of the ribs and eliminating the
need to have separate attach angles.
The manufacturing plan for the RTM wing concept calls for the
stiffeners to be made from dry fabric plysets cut to shape and partially
stitched to form the blade section (upstanding leg) of the stiffener. The
base flanges are then folded out to form the feathered legs which are
subsequently stitched to the skin preform. Note that the feathering or
tapering of plies must be contained within the preform and can not be
formed by simply bending the base material and by fiber slippage. The
spar caps are developed in a similar manner, except that all three flanges
22are stitched to form the "T" shape of the spar cap and then stitched to the
cover skin preform. As previously discussed the rib caps have cutouts to
allow for the stiffener carry-through. The rib caps are made by hand
laying dry fabric plysets cut to appropriate dimensions and stitching to
hold shape. All the component preforms are then stitched to the cover
skin preform which is also a dry fabric stitched plyset incorporating all
the needed ply drop-offs and pad-ups. Once all the components are
stitched together to form the cover assembly, the preform is ready to be
loaded into the RTM tool for resin injection.

23Loading of the preform into the RTM tool is one of the critical issues
with the RTM concept, preform structures of this size and magnitude have
never been handled before. Debulking and correct preform insertion into
the tool becomes necessary to maintain dimensional tolerances. Another
area of possible concern with the RTM concept is the substantial amount
of stitching required. Stitching through larger thicknesses may require
that appropriate measures be taken to ensure that fiber damage is
eliminated/minimized through the use of special stitching techniques
such as, ultrasonic needle vibration.
The rib webs, see Figure 15, are made by compression molding a
thermoplastic laminate (constant thickness) to form a bead stiffened web.
Return flanges are incorporated on the upper and lower sections of the rib
webs form additional chord material and providing a continuous load path
over the mouse holed rib caps. Also note that additional flanges forward
and aft are not required for attachment to the spars because attachment
is provided through attachment flanges incorporated in the spar webs.

Final assembly of the upper cover, lower cover and rib webs is
accomplished by mechanically fastening the rib webs to the lower cover
subassembly near the wing tip and progressing towards the wing root.
Near the wing root where there is more access, the ribs are attached from
within. Pilot holes are pre-drilled into the upper sections of the rib
webs to facilitate subsequent attachment to the upper cover. The upper
and lower covers are positioned, sealed and fastened together.
2.2.3 Automatic Tow Placement Wing Conceot
The automatic tow placed wing concept, see Figure 16, was designed
to take full advantage of the automated manufacturing process. As in the
other wing concepts the ATP concept strove to minimize parts count by
co-curing several components into large subassemblies. Inherent in the
ATP process is the capability of providing areas of thickness increases
and decreases (ply pad-ups and drop-offs) that are necessary for cost and
weight efficient structures. Some of the design features of the concept
are; one piece covers designed with integral blade stiffeners, integral
spar caps and integral rib caps with shear ties, see Figure 17. The ATP
concept also had the simplest rib web and spar web designs which are
basically stiffened web designs. Both upper and lower covers are
structurally identical with the only difference being in the thicknesses,
sizing and stiffener spacing.
25Figure 16, Automatic Tow Placed Wing Concept.
Early in the design development phase of the ATP concept continuous
blade stiffeners were selected as a low cost manufacturing approach. The
stiffeners are made by tow placing around a tapered rectangular mandrel.
Separating the mandrel into halves forming "U" channels that are placed
side-by-side to form the blade stiffeners. Pultruded stuffers are then
added in-between the "U" channel sections to fill the radius gaps, see
Figure 18. Other stiffener configurations were not deemed feasible or
cost effective with the ATP process. Using this process allows the spar
caps to be made integral with the skins which reduces the number of
26potential fuel leak paths and further reduced assembly costs. The spar
caps are developed in a similar manner to the stiffeners with material
being laid-up on tapered mandrels. However, the spar cap is built-up using
one half of a stiffener "U" channel and a tow placed "L" section for
leading edge attachment.

Integral rib caps act as shear ties for the rib webs and stabilize the
continuous blade stiffeners. This rib cap design differs from the other rib
cap designs because of the manufacturing approach. Rectangular mandrels
are used to lay-up the stiffener material which requires that the rib cap
preforms be inserted into the mandrels first. Therefore, the rib caps
could not be made continuous. The rib cap preforms are made by placing
woven prepreg material on an oven mold block for debulking. After
debulking, the preforms areloaded into the "U" channel mandrels prior to
laying-up the blade stiffener material.
27Figure 18, "U" Channel Build-up and Stuffer Insertion.
The rib webs were designed as a constant thickness hat stiffened
plate. They are made by compression molding of an automatic tow placed
thermoplastic laminate and subsequently waterjet cut to final trim
dimensions. Note that the web does not have return flanges. The spar web
is a blade stiffened shear web manufactured by placing the stiffeners into
recesses of a tool and tow placing the web material to form the
subassembly. As discussed above these two components are of simple
design and represent a low-risk approach.
A summary of the materials chosen for each component along with
the manufacturing method are shown in Table 9.

Final assembly of the ATP wing concept is accomplished by
fastening the lower sections of the rib webs to the lower cover towards
the wing tip where access is limited by size. Pilot holes on the upper
sections of the rib web provide locations for drilling and installing
fasteners to the rib caps on the upper cover. The front and rear spar webs
are then sealed and fastened to the spar cap on the lower cover. The two
box halves are then aligned, sealed and fastened in a assembly fixture. At
the rib locations near the wing tip, the remaining fasteners are then
installed through access holes. The remaining inboard rib webs are then
mechanically fastened to the rib caps through access holes or from within
the wing when there is sufficient access.
2.2.4 Braided Wina Concept
The braided wing concept was developed as an entirely braided one
piece wing, see Figure 19. Included in the design were; integral
stiffeners, integral spar caps on the upper, integral spar cap/web on the
lower cover and co-bonded rib caps. However, the braided wing concept
was dropped from further development due to the limitations of current
braiding equipment and the concern with mechanical properties. Following
29discussions with several braiding vendors it became apparent that the
current state-of-the-art braiders could not produce any structures
approaching the sizes needed for the wing concept. Some vendors
estimated that the machine would require a ten story building to house a
braider large enough to produce such large structures.
Figure 19, Braided Wing Concept.
Before stopping development of the braided concept, smaller wing
components were proposed. For example, the wing was broken down into
two or three braided segments, as shown in Figure 20, but they were
eliminated due the increased assembly costs and the fact that the size
was still an issue.
3OFigure 20, Revised Braided Concept.
Although braiding was eliminated as a wing concept, braiding of
smaller components is still considered as a viable manufacturing method.
Using the "blank sheet" design approach braiding could still be applied to
the manufacture of frames or stiffeners for example.
2.3 Desion Trade Studies Of Fuselage ConceDts
A similar approach to that used in the development of the Wing
Concepts (see Section 1.2) was used for the development of the Fuselage
Concepts. Three concepts were developed, namely; the Sandwich, the
Geodesic and the Stiffened Shell fuselages. Structurally, the three
concepts vary significantly, but all concepts were developed with the
same design philosophy. The use of low-cost automated manufacturing
processes with the appropriate material forms and co-cured
subassemblies were combined to form cost and weight efficient design
concepts.
Fuselaae Stress Analysis
Sandwich Fuselage Design
The (Lockheed) PANDA2 program was used to optimize the structural
31configuration for this concept. The panel was analyzed as a wide column,
200 inches wide and 20 inches long. This configuration represented a
quarter panel between adjacent frames. The longitudinal frame attach
blades were disregarded as panel breakers and were sized entirely by the
cover/frame joint requirements.
Unidirectional tape properties were used for sizing purposes. A tri-
axial 00/+45 Â° braid was assumed for the tubes. Three loading conditions
were used in the analysis. The conditions were maximum tension from the
crown region of the fuselage, maximum shear from the side of the
fuselage, and maximum compression from the keel region. In order to
minimize manufacturing cost, the final configuration was sized to
satisfy all three load conditions. The loads were taken from Lockheed
stress reports and are summarized in Table 10.
In the tension cases, the in-plane tension loads due to internal
pressure were added to the in-plane loads from fuselage bending. For the
compression loads, the in-plane tension from pressure was not
superimposed. Table 11 shows the loads summary after accounting for
internal pressure. In all cases, the fixed edge moments were applied to
the panels to simulate the local bending induced by the internal pressure.
Local buckling was not permitted at limit load in these analyses.

Two configurational constraints were imposed upon the optimization
for manufacturing considerations. The first restriction was that the
height of the truss core had to be greater than .44 inches (in combination
with the facings, the total section had to exceed .50 inches in depth). The
second restriction was that the pitch of the truss tubes could not exceed
1.5 inches (this gave a minimum corner angle of approximately 36
degrees).
Minimum gage requirements sized the facings in the panel
optimization at seven plies. For verification, the resulting configuration
was then analyzed for panel buckling using the BOSOR4 program. A 10 inch
panel width was used in this analysis. Good agreement between the
PANDA2 and BOSOR4 eigenvalues was achieved.
An additional sizing study was conducted without geometric
constraints to develop a pure weight optimized configuration. Minimum
gage was still maintained for the facings in this analysis. The panel
configurations resulting from the two sizing studies are shown in Figure
21.

Figure 22, shows the general configuration of a geodesic stiffened
panel and the definition of the design variables used in this sizing study.
The spacing of the circumferential frames was held at the baseline value
of 20 inches, which is the current window spacing. The acceptable ranges
for the sizing variables were set at:
40 Â° < o_ < 60 Â° 20" < d < 40"
.10" < a < .50" .75" < b < 3.50"
t = .040" minimum
The DIAL finite element code was used to size this configuration.
The analysis was performed for a flat panel with frame spacing set at 20
inches. Figure 23 shows the plot of the finite element model geometry
and the mode shape from the buckling analysis is shown in Figure 24. DIAL
is not an (automatic) optimization program, so the the model was run
34repeatedly, changing the design variables, to determine a minimum weight
configuration. _ _ FRAME

36The loads used in the geodesic panel analysis are the same as for the
Corrugated Sandwich Panels (Tables 10 and 11). For initial sizing
purposes, the stiffeners are assumed to react all of the in-plane
compression loads while the skin reacts the shear and pressure. The skin
panels are allowed to buckle at 20% of ultimate load (qa / qcr--5.0). As a
damage tolerance criteria, the fuselage shell is sized to carry ultimate
load with one bay missing.
The skins and over-wrap plies are made of toughened epoxy, with an
intermediate modulus fiber. Mechanical properties used in the sizing
analysis are:

spacing of 20 inches was retained. The stiffener configuration was
selected to be a hat section with hat angle set at 60 Â° for manufacturing
considerationsâ¢ The remaining dimensions - heights, thicknesses,
spacings, etc..., were allowed to vary for optimization analysis.
The material system considered for this concept is a hybrid of
Hercules AS4 - IM7 graphite fiber and Hercules 8552 toughened epoxy.
This combination is believed to provide the best balance of mechanical
properties, processibility and cost.
The panel was optimized for the design loads previously shown in
Table 11 using the Lockheed PASCO program. The final dimensions
resulting from this analysis are shown in Figure 25.

2.3â¢1 Sandwich Fuselaae Concept
38The sandwich fuselage concept, see Figure 26, was developed in
order to take advantage of the structural characteristics of sandwich
construction, (high stiffness/weight ratio). Some of the design features
of the concept are; good load transfer between face sheets, redundant load
paths, a smooth outer mold line (OML) with no fastener penetrations,
relatively simple circumferential spices, resin transfer molded frames
and tri-axial braided/pultruded triangular stiffeners. The sandwich
construction was developed by placing the triangular tubes side-by-side
and covering them with face sheets. The tubes serve two purposes, they
act as 'core' material to separate the face sheets and also function as
stringers providing longitudinal stiffness. This approach provides for a
failsafe design through multiple load paths. One of the main benefits of
the tubular core is that it allowed for excellent load transfer not only
between the face sheets, but also between the circumferential frames and
the outer skin. At the frame attach points the tubes have an added
integral flange for frame attachment that provided a direct load path to
the outer face sheet, see Figure 27, this flange also acts as a Iongeron
providing additional stiffness. The frames are then attached to the skin
with clips and mechanical fasteners. By using this approach no
mechanical fasteners penetrate the fuselage skins which eliminates any
pressure sealing requirements (for fasteners). Eliminating these
fasteners reduced costs by eliminating the need for expensive countersunk
fasteners and also provided for a smooth OML surface.
Braiding was eliminated in Section 2.2.4 from further consideration
on the Braided Wing Concept, but could be considered for smaller
components. The braiding process was selected for the manufacture of
the basic triangular tubes and the flanged triangular tubes, because
braiding is an automated and efficient process for the manufacture of
relatively small components. Tri-axial braiding was selected in order to
produce tubes with fibers in the 0Â° direction as well as +45 Â° direction.
This allows the core to act as longitudinal stiffeners as well as typical
"core" material (shear). In addition, the triangular tubes have "bulb"
material, see Figure 28, to reduce the stress concentration at the corners
and to eliminate a possible void area. The braided preforms made from
prepreg tow are pultruded to advance the resin to a rigidized and stable
shape. The "U" shaped inner skins are similarly pultruded from a braided
preform. BASF's IM7/5225 towpreg has previously been successfully
braided. Pultruding in-line with braiding can also be a very cost-effective
39operation. Pultruding from dry braided or woven/stitched preforms with
Shell 9310 type epoxy systems may be an alternate approach if pultruding
braided prepreg is not feasible.

Triangular mandrels for the braided tubes can be fly-away mandrels
such as Rohacell polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam or another expanded
polymer foam with similar properties that can withstand 100 psi and the
350Â°F cure autoclave cycle. Removable metal mandrels, silicone rubber
mandrels with expansion holes are other options considered for
fabrication.
The manufacturing plan proposed two options for the assembly of
the fuselage skin and core. Option A uses a female tool and requires that
the skin be automatic tape laid and cured separately, spraying a layer of
adhesive on the skin and placing the triangular tubes side-by-side to form
the first section between flanged tubes, see Figure 29. Adhesive is
sprayed on all mating surfaces prior to final placement. Once the initial
tubular sections are in position, the inner skin is added in-between the
flanged tubes. This process is repeated to form the two fuselage sections
that are subsequently bagged, cured and then joined to form the circular
section. The mandrels are removed after fabrication.
Option B proposed a male tool and allowed the entire circumference
to be made at once. One inner skin segment is placed in the tool and
41sprayed with adhesive. The triangular tubes are then added in-between
the flanged ends of the inner skin segment, see Figure 30. Integrally

42flanged tubes are added at the ends of the skin segment and the the next
inner skin segment is added. Again, note that a layer of adhesive is added
prior to placing the tubes. This sequence is then repeated until all the
inner skin segments and triangular tubes have been placed. The final
operation is to automatic tape laying (ATL) the outer skin and bag and cure
the assembly. The tooling concept for triangular and flanged tube
fabrication may be similar to the one described for option A.
As discussed above, the sandwich fuselage design has resin transfer
molded circumferential frames as shown in Figure 31. The final
configuration of the frames, approaches an "F" frame configuration with
integral shear tabs for attachment to the fuselage. This attachment is
accomplished through angle clips fastened to the up-standing flange of the
flanged triangular core tubes. This design approach allows the entire
fuselage to be made with no fasteners penetrating the skin in-between the
fuselage sections.
Figure 31, "F" Frame Configuration.
43The only fuselage skin fastener penetrations are at the fuselage
splice, as shown in Figure 32. Butt splices are used for the outer skins
with the "core" and inner skin being cut back to transfer the loads into
the outer skin. Additionally, the Iongerons are spliced through bath tub
fittings which attach to the skin and the up-standing flange of the
triangular tubes. The bath tub fittings are made by stretch forming from
long discontinuous fiber thermoplastic sheet. The increased material cost
of the thermoplastic material is traded-off in this case for the increased
flexibility of the stretch forming process.

442.3.2 Geodesic Fuselaae ConceDt
The geodesic fuselage concept, shown Figure 33, features a
completely co-cured fuselage assembly with continuous helical
stiffeners, excellent damage tolerance characteristics and no fastener
penetrations through the pressure shell. Circumferential stiffeners were
added to allow for frame attachment. Note, the circumferential stiffeners
are discontinuous in order to allow the helical stiffeners to be continuous
Figure 33, Geodesic Fuselage Concept.
45around the fuselage section and permit the use of automated
manufacturing processes such as, automated tape laying. Helical
stiffeners are over-wrapped to assist in stabilizing the stiffeners and to
provide a shear path to the skin.
The geodesic fuselage concept takes advantage of a Lockheed/Hysol
developed material system (Filcoat) composed of a layer of
graphite/thermoset prepreg and a layer of syntactic material. These are
joined to form a two layer "tape" ideally suited for the manufacture of
over-lapping structures. In forming the helical stiffeners the tape is laid
down in an over-lapping layer-by-layer manner causing a doubling of the
thickness at the intersection/node points. This doubling of the thickness
at the intersection normally requires that the material be spread-out as it
is being laid-up to eliminate the doubling effect or that one layer be
discontinuous. Using the Filcoat material eliminates the doubling of
thickness effect by allowing the syntactic material to be squeezed out at
the intersection to form a solid layer of graphite/epoxy. The construction
of the stiffener section between nodes is an alternating layer of Gr/Ep and
syntactic material, see Figure 34.
The main drawback of composite geodesic designs is that they are
very difficult to join. Splicing fuselage sections with geodesic stiffeners
is complicated by, the large number of stiffeners, the tolerances
associated with the stiffener locations and the lack of tapering capability
in the stiffener section. This is one major area of concern with the
geodesic fuselage that was to be investigated further in the "Structural
Concept Development" part of task I. Another concern with the geodesic
concept is the requirement that the stiffeners be covered (over-wrapped)
which greatly increases manufacturing complexity and costs. Due to the
lack of fiber continuity at the stiffener/skin interface, over-wrapping of
the stiffeners was needed to increase the bond area between the stiffener
and the skin.
Manufacturing of the stiffener over-wraps is accomplished by
pultruding from prepreg and cutting the pultruded segments to proper size
and placing the over-wraps into recesses in the fuselage mandrel. At the
intersection points, see Figure 35, the stiffener over-wraps extend and
are made from a woven preform which is resin transfer molded, and then
placed in the fuselage mandrel for subsequent co-bonding.
46ALTERNATING LAYERS OF
GRAPHITE/EXPOXY AND
SYNTACTIC MATERIAL
Figure 34, Stiffener Build-up With Filcoat Material,
(Two Plies Shown).
As previously discussed, the circumferential stiffeners are
discontinuous at the intersection points. The manufacturing of
circumferential stiffeners can best be accomplished by curved pultrusion
of a fiber preform or resin infusion of a stitched preform. Curved
pultrusion has been successfully demonstrated by pultrusion/pull-
forming. Both processes allow B-staging or advancing the resin to a
rigidized state that can be laid into the fuselage tool for final assembly.
The helical stiffeners are blade shaped stiffeners and are made by tape
placing the Filcoat material into the recesses of the fuselage mandrel
following the installation of over-wrap components (See Figure 36).
47As the helical pattern is developed the material is laid-up to form blade
stiffeners with the tape overlapping from two directions at the
intersections. Again, this overlapping problem is alleviated by the
flowability of the syntactic half of the tape. During the cure cycle the
syntactic material softens and flows leaving only the Gr/Ep material at
the intersections.

After all the components have been placed into the recesses of the
fuselage tool and the helical stiffeners tape laid, the outer skin is tow

then envelope bagged and cured.

The circumferential frames for the geodesic fuselage is a "F"
configuration with cutouts at the helical stiffener intersections. The
Xerkon autocomp molding process was selected for the manufacture of the
circumferential frames. A dry fiber stitched preform and resin film are
placed into the Autocomp matched mold and the resin is infLJsed into the
layers of material. The "F" frames are then mechanically fastened to the
circumferential stiffeners of the fuselage on final assembly.

the manufacturing method are shown below in Table 13.

costs and consisted of an outer skin, open section hat stiffeners and
"J" section circumferential frames. Features of the concept includes;
continuous hat pultruded stiffeners, good damage tolerance
characteristics through redundant load paths and resin film infused (RFI)
frames. All of these features combine to form a relatively simple design
ideally suited to co-curing. During conceptual development hat stiffeners
5Owere selected to produce a low-cost design. This had the beneficial
effect that the stiffeners could be made by braiding and pultrusion (two
low-cost manufacturing processes). Another main benefit was the ability
to reduce the total number of stiffeners required. An added feature of the
hat stiffeners is that they are more stable than other stiffening concepts,
such as blades. Hat stiffeners generally do not require the addition of
clips to stabilize the stiffener at the frame intersections.
The manufacturing plan calls for the "J" frames to be a textile
preform made by the braiding or knitting/stitching processes. These
preforms can be fabricated either by resin transfer molding or resin
infusion molding processes. (See Figure 38 for the basic tooling
approach.) Resin infusion processes allow a controlled B-staging or
advancing of a resin for a subsequent co-cure on final assembly of the
shell-stiffened fuselage section.

51The hat stiffeners are open sections and can be formed from tri-
axially braided material. The hat stiffened preforms are then pultrudable
to a rigidized B-stage form to be co-cured in the final assembly. The
braiding process allows the tailoring of properties by the addition of 0Â°
fibers in the cap areas for structural efficiency. Pultrusion of BASF-5225
prepreg has been carried out under controlled conditions. Another
approach is that the dry preform can be pultruded using epoxy resins like
Shell 9310.
Prior to the insertion of the frame into the fuselage assembly tool,
the "mouse holes" for the hat stiffeners must be cut into the frame and
plugs inserted to fill the void. The hat stiffeners and the frames are then
placed with teflon support mandrels in the recesses of the fuselage
assembly tool, see Figure 39. Teflon mandrels are easily removable after
final assembly and provide sufficient pressure during molding through
thermal expansion. The outer skin is then filament wound over the tool
and stiffener assembly. The entire section is then bagged and cured in an
autoclave for final assembly. As discussed above, the use of hat
stiffeners allows the omission of shear-ties to the frame. This also
allows the fuselage tool to be simplified, further reducing tooling
assembly costs. Co-curing the fuselage shell eliminates the use of
fasteners and reduces assembly steps/costs.
A summary of the material systems for each component along with
the manufacturing method are shown below in Table 14.

53The cost estimates developed are based on 300 aircraft, with a lot
size of 24, and a production rate of not more than 10 aircraft per month.
The estimates assume current state-of-the-art methods and procedures
with the exception of any existing limitations due to size. All costs are
based on 1990 constant year dollars.
The methodology used on the ACT program is a combination of a
variety of methods each depending on the design concept and
manufacturing plan associated with the particular concept. All use
standard hours as the basis for recurring manufacturing labor and unit
material costs as the basis for material cost. Other recurring costs, such
as recurring engineering, quality, and tooling are factored from the
manufacturing costs based on historical data. After the determination of
the time standards for each part or assembly, they are converted to
estimated actual hours through the use of variance factors and learning
curves. The labor hours are converted to dollars by the application of the
appropriate labor rate. The material cost is added after applying
material burden and escalation factors. Quality and sustaining
engineering and tooling are included to determine the total recurring cost.
2.4.2 Cost Comparisons and Contributors
2.4.2.1 Wing Desion/Manufacturing Concepts
Cost estimates developed for the baseline L-1011 wing box and the
advanced design/manufacturing concepts are summarized in Figures 40
through 43. Shown in these figures are a breakdown of the wing costs by
component along with the cost distribution by cost element for each
concept.
Modular Wing Box Concept
As a result of fewer components during assembly, lower stringer
costs are indicated, as well as, reduced assembly costs. The upper and
lower surface assemblies are the highest cost contributors due generally
to their size and co-curing of multiple rib caps and stringers. The rib web
costs assume thermoplastic tape compression molded to the part
configuration. The results of a trade study comparing alternatives of

successful joint.

Resin Transfer Molded Concept
The high cost contributor identified in this concept is the placement
of the assembled wing cover preform into the RTM tool. Multiple tools are
assumed for accurate dimensional control as the resin is injected.
Stitching costs could possibly be understated since the number of stitches
assumed are considered only sufficient to hold the material together.
Automatic Tow Placement Concept
An overall cost reduction of 24% is indicated over the baseline
metallic box structure. Again, the high cost contributor is the
placement/assembly of the wing skin components. A risk consideration
involves the credibility of extending an automated placement process to a
structure of the size being considered.
2.4.2.2 Me,terial Cost Sensitivity Study
A cost of 40 dollars per pound for graphite composite material was
assumed. The cost estimate for each advanced design/manufacturing
concept was iterated by adjusting the base material through a range
from 20 to 65 dollars per pound. The results are depicted in Figures 44
59through 46. As shown in these figures, material cost variances have a
very significant impact on the cost of composite structures.
2.4.2.3 Wina Soar Trade Study
A trade study on alternate spar concepts was conducted and the results
are shown in Table 16. The "C" channel configuration is relatively less
than the "1" beam configuration for all concepts considered. In all cases,
the "C" channel consists of essentially one half of the lay-ups required
for the "1" channel.
2.4.2.4 Fuselaae Desian/Manufacturina ConceDts
Cost estimates for the baseline fuselage component and the
advanced design/manufacturing concepts developed are summarized in
Figures 47 through 50. Cost distribution by component and cost element
is shown for each concept.
Cost Benefits/Drivers
Sandwich Concept - Costs are moderated through automated
fabrication methods. However, cost benefit is nullified due to added
number of parts and the associated increased assembly time.
Geodesic Concept Cost benefit is achieved from the commonality
of details parts. High cost is due to a significant increase in the number
of parts being fabricated and assembled.
Stiffened Shell Concept - This concept offers a significant
improvement due to reduced part count through co-cured assemblies and
elimination of fasteners. Cost is increased by complexity of tooling
required.

Weights analysis were preformed for the three wing concepts
(Automatic Tow Placed, Resin Transfer Molded and Modular), the Braided
wing had been previously dropped and the three fuselage concepts
(Sandwich, Geodesic and Stiffened Shell) developed in the "Initial
Assessment/Ranking" phase of task 1. The weights developed were based
on the design packages received from the Design/Manufacturing
Integration (DIM I) team. The composite weights were then compared to
the Lockheed L-1011-1 baseline aircraft weights. Baseline weights were
obtained from L-1011 files and reviewed to insure that a "component" to
"component" comparison was obtained.
2.5.1 Weights Estimating Assumptions
During the weight estimating process the total weight for the wing
box structure was developed. The weight was broken down to include the
upper cover, lower cover, ribs, bulkheads, spar structure and body/main
landing gear support structure. All weights reported are based on per
aircraft estimates.
The weight was first estimated for outer wing station (OWS) 151.1
from the composite design drawings. Then a spanwise variation, see
Figure 51, based on L-1011 data was applied to arrive at the total weight
for each wing concept. Actual weights were determined for the
upper/lower covers, ribs and spar webs, additional estimated weight was
then added for the landing gear, engine mounts and access doors. The
results of the wing weights analysis are shown in Table 17.
For the fuselage concepts the total weight was estimated for the
fuselage shell between fuselage station (FS) 235 to FS 983 based on the
composite design drawings developed by the D/M I team. The sizing on the
drawings were developed for FS 750 and included the skins, stiffeners and
frames. No circumferential variation was assumed or applied, an average
section was analyzed. The results of the fuselage weights analysis are
shown in Table 18.

2.,5.2 Weight Drivers
Several items have been identified as weight drivers during the
weights analysis based on past experience. Those items that were
71identified are listed below:
â¢ Discrete vs. Integral Stiffeners
â¢ Number of Fasteners
â¢ Material Form
As discussed above, all of the design wing and fuselage concepts
strove to minimize costs and weights through the use of co-cured and/or
co-bonded structures. By using this design philosophy the effects of the
first two items listed above are diminished. Leading to the selection of
integrally stiffened structures wherever possible
Some additional items are known to be potential weight drivers but
were not investigated in detail in the "Initial/Assessment Ranking" part
of task 1. These topics are;
â¢ Joints
â¢ Cut-outs
â¢ Uniform vs. Tailored Thickness
and are further developed in the next part of task 1 "Structural Design
Development".
2.5.3 Weights Com.oarison
Figure 52 shows the results of the composite design weights
analysis and the aluminum L-1011 baseline weights. As can be seen the
Automatic Tow Placed wing concept has the highest weight savings at
31.8%. The Modular wing concept is second with a 28.7% weight savings
and finally the Resin Transfer Molded wing concept at a 21.3% weight
savings. Figure 53 shows the results of the fuselage weights analysis and
the baseline fuselage weights. The Stiffened Shell concept is the lightest
with a 30.3% weight savings. The Sandwich concept is second at 23.3%
weight savings and the Geodesic concept is last at 14.9% weight savings.
The program goals for weight savings were 40% for a re-sized
aircraft. The approach taken was to adjust the weight goal to account for
re-sizing of the aircraft, and to use the L-1011 baseline configuration as

73is (not re-sized). Therefore, the 40% goal was modified to 34% to account
for re-sizing of the aircraft. The 6% reduction is a very conservative
estimate of the gains possible with the re-sizing effect. Re-sizing the
aircraft would reduce the amount of fuel required to meet the same
flight/range requirements. Also, the fuel weight reduction allows the
engine to be re-sized, this creates a "snow ball" effect which can lead to
substantial reductions or increases in range, payload, etc.
2.6 SuDoortability Trade Studies
All wing and fuselage design concepts were developed with supportability
issues in mind. The major emphasis was in developing a
maintainable(cid:0)repairable structural concept that could be supported in the
field with standard repair procedures.
2.6.1 Rationale
Following completion of the design packages all of the concepts were
evaluated for maintainability/repair, inspectability and
durability/damage tolerance concerns. Experts in the respective fields
evaluated the concepts and rated them accordingly from 1 to 10 with 10
being the highest. The results from these evaluations are shown in Tables
19 through 21.
2.7 Trade Study Result_
After all cost, weights and "llities" evaluations were completed,
the down select process discussed below was used to determine which
concepts to carry into the "Structural Concept Development" subtask of
task 1. In the development subtask the concepts would be developed in
further detail, focusing on detail design of joints, cutouts, etc... The
original plan was to take the top two wing and fuselage concepts into the
development part of task 1. However, following NASA redirection only the
top wing and the top fuselage were carried into the development subtask.

The program goals of 40% weight savings, 25% cost savings and 50%
part count reduction were assigned a weighting factor of 30%, 40% and
30%, respectively. Cost had previously been selected as the main program
goal and was therefore weighted the highest, with weights and "llities"
being weighted equally. The down select scores for cost and weights were
developed by comparing the actual weight or cost to the target weight or
cost through the following formula,
Score = (Wg / Wd) x Wf
where;
Wg = Weight or Cost Goal
Wd = Weight or Cost of Design
Wf = Weighting Factor (30 for Weights and 40 for Cost)
It was possible for the concepts to earn "bonus points" by
surpassing the target goals. For example, if the weight goal was 20,000
Ibs and a concepts estimated weight was 18,000 Ibs that concept would
score 33.3 points (20000/18000x30), exceeding the the weighting factor.
76The "llities" evaluation was conducted by having experts in the
various disciplines score the concepts from one to ten (10 being the best),
taking the average and multiplying by the weighting factor (.3 for
"llities"). The disciplines involved were; Design, Manufacturing and
Producibility. These evaluations were combined with those developed in
Section 1.6 (Inspectability, Maintainability/Repair and Damage
Tolerance/Durability) to form a complete overall evaluation of the
concepts. Table 22 shows the results of the "llities" trade study results.
These scores were added to the cost and weights scores to arrive at the
total scores for each concept.
2.7.1 Wing Results
Table 23 shows the final results of the down select ranking of the
wing concepts. The Automatic Tow Placed wing is the clear winner with a
score of 85.65 well above the Modular wing concept ranking second with a
score of 73.77 and finally the RTM wing with a score of 71.95. Therefore,
the ATP wing concept was carried into the development subtask of task 1.
The ATP wing concept scored very well in both the cost and weights areas
by nearly matching the target goals. All three concepts were scored fairly
closely in the weights area. It is interesting to note that the RTM concept
scored well in the "llities" area while being penalized in the cost area.
This was due to difficulties in loading the preform into the tool and high
tool costs. In summary, some of the details of the ATP wing concept are
shown in Figure 54 below. The concept had integral co-cured blade
stiffeners and spar caps, co-cured rib caps and mechanically attached rib
webs.

2.7.2 Fuselage Results
The results of the fuselage down select ranking shown in Table 24
indicate that the Stiffened Shell concept (87.99 points) is the winner by a
substantial margin, over 20 points. In second place is the Sandwich
fuselage concept (63.90 points) and finally the Geodesic concept (48.88
points). Therefore, the Stiffened Shell concept was carried into the
development subtask of task 1. The large spread in scores can be
attributed to the substantial difference in design configurations. The
Stiffened Shell concept was awarded "bonus" points for exceeding the
cost target goal. While the Geodesic was penalized heavily on cost for
having too many parts, addition of all the stiffener covers greatly
increased the manufacturing/assembly costs. The Sandwich concept
scored best in the weights area which was to be expected, sandwich
construction is generally very weight efficient. Figure 55 shows some of
79the details of the Stiffened Shell concept, which consisted of a simple
design with co-cured hat stiffeners and "J" section circumferential
frames.

803.0 Structural Desian Conce0t
At the completion of the design trade studies the results were
presented to NASA personnel at a formal review. Since one wing and
fuselage concept emerged as clear winners it was agreed that the
remainder of Task 1 would concentrate on these two concepts and no
backups would be carried into the next subtask.
Boeing and Douglas had performed similar trade studies . Following
full review of all three contracts NASA determined that Boeing and
Lockheed had reached very similar conclusions.
The NASA ACT Steering Committee discussed the results of the
three program trade studies in the fall of 1990 and recommended that
future work be focused in three areas: resin transfer molding, automated
fiber placement and textile structures. By mutual agreement Lockheed
was selected to concentrate on textile structures and to restructure
Phase II of the program to this end.
This section discusses
The remaining Task 1 effort was terminated.
the efforts in subtask 2 prior to the termination.
Following the August 1, 1990 program review, NASA directed that
the back-up concepts be eliminated from further consideration because
the winners were ahead by a considerable margin and showed potential for
meeting the programs goals. Therefore, only the Automatic Tow Placed
Wing and the Stiffened Shell Fuselage were carried into the detail design
subtask. The Modular Wing and the Sandwich Fuselage concepts were
dropped from further consideration.
In the "Initial Assessment/Ranking" subtask, the wing and fuselage
concepts were developed in enough detail to generate cost and weight
data. For the second subtask - "Structural Concept Development", the
winning concepts were to be defined in greater detail paying particular
attention to such details as; cutouts, joints, taper effects, etc.
In the Structural Design Development subtask, new manufacturing
81processes were to be evaluated in an attempt to further reduce costs. For
the wing, two manufacturing processes were to be evaluated and
compared. One of the panel concepts was the original fully automatic tow
placed panel. The other panel concept was a braided/automatic tow placed
concept, with the U-channel blade stiffeners braided and the skin
automatic tow placed. This allowed for a cost as well as structural
comparison and a final selection of the best process for this application.
Material
The material system proposed for the ATP Wing and Stiffened Shell
Fuselage concepts is a hybrid of Hercules AS4 - IM7 graphite fiber and
Hercules 8552 toughened epoxy. This combination is believed to provide
the best balance of mechanical properties, processibility and cost. The
AS4/IM7 hybrid allows the tailoring of mechanical properties. For
example, in the wing covers high modulus (high cost) IM7 fiber will be
used in the stiffeners and high strength (low cost) AS4 fiber for the skin
areas. The 8552 toughened epoxy is a 350Â°F cure, 180Â°F service system
that is available in all material forms required for this task. This hybrid
system is estimated, by Hercules, to cost $40/Ib for a 66% AS4 - 34%
IM7/8552 mix in the large production volume range. This estimated
material cost is consistent with the cost data generated in the "Initial
Assessment Ranking" subtask.

; t.J...LoJm
Planned work on joints in wing structures had not begun at the time
of program redirection.
3.1.2 Cutouts
All cutouts required for access doors, fuel probes, etc., were laid
out for the upper and lower wing covers. Different skin/stiffener tapering
configurations were developed for discussion with Hercules in order to
get a better understanding of the capabilities of their tow placement
82machine.
Five design approaches, see Figures 56 through 60, for handling
cutouts were developed and presented to the DIM I team for review. The
first two concepts used metallic inserts for local reinforcement while
the final three concepts were all composite designs. Concept #1
attempted to redistribute the cutout loads through metallic (Ti) inserts in
the U-channel sections Concept #2 was similar to concept #1 except that
the loads were redistributed through a metallic doubler in the outer skin
of the panel. Concept #3 fully utilized the ATP process by placing some of
the material around the cutout area. Concept #4 placed the Gr/Ep doubler
material in the U-channel sections and had a constant section outer skin,
and, finally, Concept 5 placed some of the Gr/Ep doubler material in both
the U-channel section and the outer skin.

OF POOR QUALrI-yTable 25 shows some of the pros and cons identified for each
concept. Following the review by the D/M I team, the more promising
concepts were to be further developed and examined to determine their
impact on cost and weights. Of the five cutout concepts under
consideration, two were eliminated from further consideration. Concepts
# 1 and # 2 (with metal inserts) were dropped because they were thought
to be less effective and created several manufacturing(cid:0)inspection
problems. Also Concept #3 (curved plies/heavy channels) and Concept #5
(heavy skin/channel) were combined as they are similar concepts. Concept
#5 would be the back-up if the curved plies concept were not feasible.
Therefore, the remaining concepts (all composite designs) were: Concept
#3 with the local reinforcement in both the outer skin (with the curved
plies) and the U-channels; and Concept #4 with the heavy U-channels and
constant section outer skin. These two concepts were to be further
developed and analyzed for cost and weights impact, however, all activity
on task 1 was terminated.
.2.1.3 Ta0er Effects
For the ATP wing, a more detailed layout of the L-1011 baseline
wing was started to investigate the weight impact of changing the blade
stiffener spacing to better match-up with the rib spacing. This was an
attempt to reduce costs by simplifying the stiffener termination at the
front spar. After investigating several different spacing and taper
schemes for the wing stiffeners, it was determined that this option was
not practical. This is mainly due to the high spanwise taper ratio of the
wing causing many stiffeners to terminate along the span. Terminating
the stiffeners causes manufacturing difficulties as well as creating a
poor design by causing relatively large jumps in panel sizes. Therefore,
this option was eliminated from further consideration.
2.1.4 Test Plan-Wing Structures
The Test Plan is shown in Table 26. The test plan made use of the
building block approach to allow for the refinement of the designs and the
manufacturing approaches used. All critical features of both the wing and
fuselage concepts were to be examined. Wing Element Tests were to
evaluate different manufacturing approaches and material forms. The

cover/blade pull-off test was to validate the structural integrity of the
interface between the blade and the skin. In this test different material
forms such as braiding instead of automatic tow placement would have
been evaluated. The rib cap/cover pull-off test was designed to validate
the design and manufacturing concepts for the integral rib caps. Again,
different material forms and cap configurations would be evaluated. The
final wing element test was the cover/blade compression test which was
88to further validate the upper/lower cover design and manufacturing
concepts.
Following the element tests two wing cover configurations were to
be evaluated during the Wing Subcomponent Testing. The subcomponents
to be tested were the spar cap and a three stiffener compression panel.
The spar cap test was to validate the integral spar cap configuration and
its joint to the spar web. The three-stiffener panel test was intended to
validate the design and compare the damage tolerance of the selected
concepts.
The selected wing concept relied heavily on the availability of a
totally automated lay-up method with the capability of planform and
thickness tapering. Hercules and Cincinnati Milacron are two companies
with this unique manufacturing capability and as such were considered as
potential subcontractors for the manufacture of test components.
Lockheed personnel visited Hercules Aerospace Co. in Magna, Utah to
witness first hand their automated fiber placement machine in operatior
and to discuss the design(cid:0)manufacturing approach for test panel
fabrication. The demonstration of the machines capabilities showed the
equipment was capable of producing the structural requirements.
3.2 Fuselaae Structures
Structural concept development of the Stiffened Shell Fuselage
concept concentrated on designing a fuselage section with a door.
Although no plans existed to build a door section, the effect of a door on
adjacent sections was pertinent. Topics of concern were areas such as
the skin splice locations and the stringer transition from one barrel
section to another.
Major emphasis during the structural concept development of the
Stiffened Shell Fuselage configuration was placed on: (1) establishing
suitable splice locations for the fuselage panel assemblies, (2) developing
a design philosophy for the window belt structure and (3) evaluating
alternate design concepts for circumferential and longitudinal splices.
The major cost driver in aircraft structures has been shown to be
89assembly costs. In order to minimize assembly costs, large co-cured
panels were proposed for the Stiffened Shell Fuselage. These large panels
were to be spliced longitudinally at locations that were deemed to be
convenient for assembly. Ideally, the lower fuselage section, consisting
of the skin and floor beams, would go together first. The upper skin
panels would then be installed to complete the barrel section. Figure 61
shows examples of splice concepts.
One recurring concern expressed by the D/M I team was been the
mandrel requirements for the hat stiffeners. Therefore, Manufacturing
was assigned the task of finalizing those requirements. They were to
determine the specific capabilities available of current and emerging
technology and provide inputs as to which direction the Stiffened Shell
concept should take. The mandrel capabilities will influence the design by
either requiring a fully cured hat stiffener to be bonded on at the final
cure cycle, or allowing the use of a B-staged hat stiffener and co-curing
the final assembly. Another task assigned to the D/M I team was to
finalize the inspection requirements to the hat stiffeners. This task is
also influenced by the selection of a mandrel/hat stiffener configuration.
The L-1011 baseline does not rely upon stringers between the door
cutouts for the lateral bending loads. It uses a thicker skin in this area.
A study was initiated to compare this design philosophy versus using
continuous stringers along with a thinner skin above and below the
windows and between the door cutouts. Also to be evaluated was the need
for a circumferential fail safe straps as used on the L-1011.
As several tooling methods for the hat section stringers were
evaluated, how they would apply to double contoured sections and not just
a constant section was considered. It appeared that a pultrusion worked
well for a constant section because the outside surface is a tool surface;
this gave a better fit to adjacent parts. However, a different approach is
required for the double contour section. Figure 62 shows the stringer
penetrating a frame, a pre-molded clip bonds them together. The design of
the stringer termination was not to be decided upon until a tooling
concept was developed.

fuselage element tests to be conducted were stringer/shell pull-off,
frame/shell pull-off, shell/stringer compression and pressure integrity
after low velocity impact tests. Stringer/shell pull-off tests evaluate
92various configurations of the fuselage shell/stringer joint. The
frame/shell pull-off test would determine the structural properties of
the co-cured joint. Shell/stringer compression tests were to be used to
further validate the shell design and manufacturing concepts. Pressure
integrity after low velocity impact tests were designed to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the design to sustain in-service impacts.
Using a building block approach, fuselage subcomponent tests were
to be conducted following the element tests and were intended to evaluate
two configurations for frame bending and three-stringer panels in
compression. The shear panel and five-stringer compression panel tests
were only to evaluate the most promising configurations. Frame bending
tests were to be performed to validate the innovative manufacturing
processes proposed for the frames. The three-stringer compression panel
tests were designed to evaluate the structural integrity and damage
tolerance of the shell design. The shear panel test was to simulate
structure with the highest shear loading in the fuselage; panels were to be
tested undamaged, damaged and with two lifetimes fatigue with damage.
Finally, the five-stringer compression panel, which represents structure
in the area of highest compression loading, was to be tested with impact
damage in a critical area.
In support of the test plan the first panel design drawing, for the
coupon and element test specimens, was initiated. It was planned to
fabricate one panel that comprises all of the test specimens. The panel
would then be cut to obtain the individual specimens. This activity was
halted before completion, however, pending redirection from NASA.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200words)
Composite Wing and Fuselage Structural Design/Manufacturing
Concepts have been developed and evaluated. Trade studies were
performed to determine how well the concepts satisfy the program
goals of 25% cost savings, 40% weight savings with aircraft
resizing and 50% part count reduction as compared to the aluminum
Lockheed L-1011 baseline. The concepts developed using emerging
technologies such as; large scale RTM, ATP, Braiding, out-of-
autoclave and automated manufacturing processes both thermoset
and thermoplastic materials were evaluated for possible
application in the design concepts. Trade studies were used to
determine which concepts carry into the detailed design
development subtask.
