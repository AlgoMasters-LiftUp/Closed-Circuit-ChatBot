parameters of FSW welding on the thermal characteristics of weld joints in aluminum and magnesium alloys,
numerically. The simulation results confirmed that the temperature distribution is high from shoulder towards
the borders of the parts and it was symmetrical with respect to the middle plane. The calculated maximum
temperatures for magnesium and aluminum were 843.7 K & 702 K, respectively.
