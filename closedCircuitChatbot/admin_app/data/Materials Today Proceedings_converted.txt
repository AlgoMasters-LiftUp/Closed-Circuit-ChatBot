Keywords: The pursuit for improved performance in the aerospace and aviation industries has inspired the development,
Aerospace investigation, and research of advanced materials. Since the last few years, a lot of research on different alloys,

nium, and nickel-based alloys have been developed with certain advantages like strength-to-weight ratio,
corrosion resistance, wear resistance etc. However, there are major challenges to aerospace materials such as
insufficient mechanical and chemical properties, overall weight of aircraft, fretting wear, stress corrosion
cracking, incapability at high temperatures, and low oxidation resistance. Therefore, vast studies have been
conducted for the development of next-generation aerospace materials. In the present article, attention has been
made to study the contemporary materials, current research going on and future trends on advanced materials in
the field of aerospace engineering. Aluminium-based alloys are found as the most widely used metal alloys in the
aerospace sector for their strong mechanical properties. However, polymer matrix composites and metal matrix
composites have gained popularity due to their exceptional strength and stiffness. Titanium-based alloys are
favoured for their strength and corrosion resistance, leading to increased adoption.

principal material for the structural components of aeroplanes [4]. Due
