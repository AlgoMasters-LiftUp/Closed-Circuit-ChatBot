Abstract
With the increasingly excellent performance of magnesium alloy materials, magnesium alloys are increasingly widely used under the urgent
need for weight reduction in aerospace applications. However, due to the severe aviation environment, the strength, corrosion resistance
and electrical conductivity of magnesium alloy materials need to be further improved. Many scholars are committed to studying higher
comprehensive mechanical properties. Besides, they have studied surface treatment processes with space application characteristics, such as
high emissivity oxidation and high anti-corrosion electroplating. To further improve the safety and reliability of magnesium alloys and expand
their applications, this paper discusses several kinds of magnesium alloys and summarizes their research progress. The whole manuscript
should be revised by an expert who has more experience on English writing. At the same time, the surface treatments of magnesium alloy
materials for aerospace are analyzed. Besides, the application of magnesium alloy in aerospace field is summarized. With the in-depth research
of many scholars, the improvement of material properties and the development of surface protection and functional technology, it is believed
that magnesium alloys will be used in more and more aerospace applications and make more contributions to the aerospace field.

magnesium in electronic chassis can result in weight savings
of approximately 25% over aluminum, containing the plating

With the improvement of magnesium alloy’s toughness,
corrosion resistance, forming performance, etc., magnesium
is gradually considered for use in products such as brackets,
storage tanks, heat pipes, honeycomb panel skins, and embed-
ded parts [14 , 133 , 134] . However, the lightweight of structure
causes a lowering of stiffness, thus the way for weight saving
for some structures is not so flexible, and the same value of
stiffness must be kept while weight saving. Moreover, some
other properties need to be considered. When used as the seat
structure, the flammability properties are needed to be con-
