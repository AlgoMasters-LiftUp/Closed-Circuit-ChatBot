least two elements working together to produce material
properties that are different to the properties of those
elements on their own.
Typically reinforcing fibres in a matrix.

Development of composites for aerospace use was both costly and

potentially risky, therefore initial development was performed by military who
had relatively large development budgets and are not so risk averse as the
civil side.
On the civil side, composite development was restricted to non-structural

applications.
However, the drivers to produce light-weight

structures were provided by:
Price of oil

Change in attitude towards environmental issues

(e.g. the ACARE targets of 50% reduction in C0 ,
2
a 50% reduction in perceived noise and an 80%
Reduction in NO by 2020).

Predicted increase in airline

traffic.

Composites give the OEMs the opportunity to produce lightweight

structures thereby reducing fuel bills and reducing emissions.
The cost of development and introduction of these new structures is

now offset by the gains.
Hence the increase in the usage of composites in aerostructures.

Opportunities:

Prepreg and autoclave cure has traditionally been the standard for

aerospace - necessary to guarantee ultimate quality (high V ).
f
Not appropriate for very large scale structures and preparation and

cycle times are long.
Lay-up process Autoclave Cure process
17 © 2013 Avalon Consultancy Services LtdManufacturing
With build rates rising to satisfy demand, the OEMs needed to find a

way, without compromising quality, to:
Increase production rate.

Eliminate autoclave.

This has produced two trends:

Automated production.

e.g. Automated tape laying (ATL),
automated fibre placement (AFP).
Out of autoclave processing.

e.g. Infusion, SCRIMP, RFI, RTM.AFP/ATL
AFP (automated fibre placement)

and ATL (automated tape laying)
provide rapid automated
placement of strips of prepreg
material onto a mould.
AFP can be used with much more

complex geometries because it
lays narrow tows, which can be
steered over sharply curved
surfaces whereas wider tapes
cannot be so placed without
buckling some of the fibres and
potentially weakening the
laminate.
Cure can either be done in or out

of an autoclave as long as an
appropriate material is used.
Examples of usage are 787 nose

and A350 fuselage panels.Out of autoclave processing
Process involves laying up of dry

fabric and introduction of resin either
in wet or film form using a vacuum to
pull it through the fabric.
There are many variations on the

technique and therefore a wealth of
names and acronyms – vacuum
infusion, resin film infusion (RFI),
vacuum assisted resin transfer
moulding (VARTM), SCRIMP etc.
This technique allows the use of

technical textiles, which provides
more design freedom and enhanced
through thickness properties.
However, the resin usually has to

have a relatively low viscosity to
allow it to flow through the fabric,
which can mean compromising on
toughness of the final part.
Example – A380 rear bulkhead and

A400M cargo door.Textiles

Maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) requirements of composites are

very different from those of metals.
Shorter track record of use than metallic structures, many MRO companies

therefore do not have much experience of maintaining composite structures.
Parts are designed to cope with typical defects/damage (although given

variations in microstructure in composites, even this can be difficult) but non-
destructive testing is required to pick up damage/growth beyond these limits.
Specific challenges with maintenance:

Specific defect types due to inhomogeneous nature of composites.

Defects are initiated during manufacturing as well as in-service.

Inspection regime usually involves use of several NDT techniques.

New and developments in existing techniques offer improvements in

current state of the art, but these need to be validated and certified.

25 © 2013 Avalon Consultancy Services LtdMRO - Repair
Damage to composites or repair of damage to

composites involves cutting of fibres,
therefore strength and stiffness of a repaired
composite will always be compromised.
Repair of composites usually uses one of 2

techniques; bolting a patch (potentially metal)
over the damaged area or scarf repair.
A bolted patch increases weight.

Scarf repair techniques require clean

conditions, are time consuming and have
traditionally utilised expensive, and difficult to
store, prepregs.
In-field repair techniques based on dry fabric

preforms and infusion are being investigated.
Possible problems centre around the use of
brittle resins for infusion and the likelihood of
poor fatigue life and shock resistance.
26 © 2013 Avalon Consultancy Services Ltd3. Functional Composites
By virtue of the fact that composite materials consist of more than one material,
and the material is formed at the same time as the part, it is possible to
incorporate other materials or structures during processing to provide
integrated functionality to the part.
The following slides provide examples of research being done to provide
additional functionality to composite structures in the areas of:
 Self-healing
 Sensing
 Morphing
 Lightning protection
 Energy storage

In order to trigger self-healing, composites needs to be
able to detect damage, i.e. contain a health monitoring
system. There are many approaches under development
including:
Fibre Optic/Bragg Gratings
 (e.g. Aston Uni, Birmingham Uni,
Insensys, Ulster (woven structures)).
Carbon nanotubes/graphene
 (Reading Uni, Imperial, Bristol
Uni, Cambridge Uni etc.)
Ferromagnetic microwires
 (Bristol Uni)
Acoustic Emission
 (Airbus)

Structures that can change shape negate the need for motors and other
weight adding mechanisms.
Examples from Bristol University:
Tow-steered composites with variable stiffness to form bi-stable

structures. A. Panesar and P. Weaver.

Two types of effect caused by lightning strike:

 Physical damage at attachment locations.
 Indirect effects from induced voltage and current.
Prevention methods in composite structures:

 Cu foils & meshes in the outer plies.
 Co-bonding Cu strips to the inside skins of panels.
 Insulation caps on collars, nuts and fasteners.
 Conductive paints (sprayed metal).
 Al foil strips for shielding.
 Nickel-coated carbon fibres.
Examples of new innovations:

 MAST Consortium (UK MoD programme) developed an integral
woven SMA/carbon fibre preform. Improved damage tolerance
AND lightning protection.
 Bristol, M. Russ et al – CNT coatings for lightning protection.

Giving a composite structure the added functionality of being

able to store energy could allow further reductions in weight
through elimination of heavy batteries.

It is a dangerous time for the reputation of composite

structures. Increase in their use in aerostructures has
been widely reported and is being closely monitored by
the press.
The Airbus A300 crash in Queens in Nov 2001 and the

Team Phillips catamaran were classic examples of how
confidence in composites can be damaged despite neither
failure being due to deficiencies in the composite material
itself.
Delays in the production of the 787, which were primarily

due to lessons being learnt by Boeing on outsourcing of
part production, could be associated with problems in
composites part production.
It is a shame that the press is not congratulating the

aerospace industry more for innovation and development
of the use of new materials.
The fact that the sector has very strict regulations and

procedures has facilitated the safe implementation of
these new structures and all industry sectors can learn
from this.

37 © 2013 Avalon Consultancy Services Ltd3. Materials development
The recent increase in the use of composites has

involved the development of new/improved
manufacturing methods.
These manufacturing techniques are now allowing

us to develop parts that are testing the limitations of
the materials used.
Future applications will require developments in

material properties.
Example:
The Boeing 787 has a CFRP fuselage.

If Boeing wanted to scale this down to produce a

new 737 with a composite fuselage, hail stones
could potentially penetrate the fuselage.
One possible solution – rather than increasing the

thickness of the fuselage and increasing the weight
of the plane, look to use a tougher composite
material.

39 © 2013 Avalon Consultancy Services LtdSummary
Environmental regulations have meant that the cost of introduction of

lightweight composite structures is now often offset by the gains and
has led to a significant increase in the use of aerospace composite
structures.
Current challenges include:

Development of rapid rate manufacturing processes.

Coping with MRO requirements very different to metallic structures.

Avoiding reputational damage while composites are so high profile.

Current opportunities include the ability of composite structures to

include functionality such as morphing, energy storage, damage
sensing, self repair etc.
Future challenges include:

Supply of carbon fibre may struggle to match the increase in demand.

Developing applications for recycled carbon fibre.

Developing new materials to optimise output from new production methods.
