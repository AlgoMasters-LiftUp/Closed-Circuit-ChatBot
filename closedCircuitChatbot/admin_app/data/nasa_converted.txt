ADVANCED COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS AND MATERIAL
TECHNOLOGIES FOR PRIMARY AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES*

SUMMARY
Structural weight savings using advanced composites have been demonstrated for
many years. Most military aircraft today use these materials extensively and Europe
has taken the lead in their use in commercial aircraft primary structures. A major
inhibiter to the use of advanced composites in the United States is cost. Material
costs are high and will remain high relative to aluminum. The key therefore lies in
the significant reduction in fabrication and assembly costs. The largest cost in
most structures today is assembly.
As part of the NASA Advanced Composite Technology Program, Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Company has a contract to explore and develop advanced
structural and manufacturing concepts using advanced composites for transport
aircraft.
Wing and fuselage concepts and related trade studies are discussed. These
concepts are intended to lower cost and weight through the use of innovative
material forms, processes, structural configurations and minimization of parts. The
approach to the trade studies and the downselect to the primary wing and fuselage
concepts is detailed. The expectations for the development of these concepts is
reviewed.
INTRODUCTION
The Lockheed program consists of two phases. Phase 1 is currently underway and
Phase 2 is an option scheduled to start in 1992. Phase 1 consists of five tasks:
Task 1, Design/Manufacturing Concept Assessment, is the subject of this paper; Task
2, Structural Response and Failure Analysis, involves structural analysis methods
development; Task 3, Advanced Materials Concepts, covers the development of new
polymeric matrix systems for HSCT; Task 4, Assessment Review, is the phase final
review leading to a decision on whether to exercise the option for Phase 2; and Task
5, Box Beam, the subject of another paper at this conference, involves the
fabrication and assembly of the C-130 wing center box developed under a previous
NASA contract .
The goals of this program are to identify emerging technologies which will lead
to a 25 percent cost saving, a 40 to 50 percent weight saving, and a 50 percent
reduction in parts count to validate the low cost manufacturing and to verify both
the structural response and the weight savings.
APPROACH
Four wing and three fuselage concepts were selected for this program. These
concepts are shown in Figure 1. The concepts were selected based on their potential
for meeting the criteria, with a moderate risk. The Lockheed L-1011 was selected as

Figure lb. Fuselage Conceptsthe baseline airplane for this study. A wing location was selected which is
relatively highly loaded and w i l l yield test panels which can be tested in existing
test machines and fixtures. The upper surface has to be buckling critical. The
fuselage location was selected in a similar manner. Figure 2 shows the location of
the wing section, and Figure 3 shows the location of the fuselage section. The
design criteria for the wing are shown in Figure 4 and for the fuselage in Figure 5.
WING CONCEPTS
Four wing concepts were selected for the trade studies. Concept #1 is the
Modular Wing. This concept is built up of various components each of which is
fabricated using a different process. The stiffeners are pultruded, the skins are
automatic tape placed, the ribs are press formed and the spars are filament wound.
Concept 112 is the Resin Transfer Molded Wing. This concept is made from woven
stitched preforms and is molded in two pieces. Concept 113 is the Advanced Tow
Placement Wing. This concept also involves other fabrication processes, but the
covers are made by automatic tow placement (ATP). Concept 114 is the Braided Wing.
This concept is fabricated mainly by 2D and 3D braiding.
CONCEPT #I - MODULAR WING
This design is shown in Figure 6. The covers, spars and ribs are fabricated
separately and are assembled by conventional methods. The covers are blade
stiffened. The stiffeners are fabricated from dry preforms which are resin infused
and either B-staged or fully cured Tee sections. The skins are fabricated in two
parts. The inner skin is discontinuous at the stiffeners. It can be laid up by
automatic tape dispenser and can be cut into strips by a waterjet cutter or by a
Gerber cutter. The outer skin is laid up over a tool containing the stiffeners and
inner skin strips by automatic tape dispenser. The fabrication sequence is shown in
Figure 7.

Figure 7. Modular Wing Fabrication
The front and rear spars are fabricated by automatic tow placement. Alterna-
tives are filament winding or tape winding. The spars are designed as C-sections
and can be wound as pairs in the form of a rectangular box and cut into C-sections
after cure.
The ribs are fabricated as separate caps and webs. Prepreg plies are cut by
Gerber cutter, stacked, formed to shape and B-staged. The rib caps are then placed
in the cover fabrication tool along with the inner skin strips and the stiffeners
before the outer skin is laid directly on the curing tool. A caul plate is placed
over the assembly which is then bagged and cured.
The rib webs are compression molded using either thermosets or thermoplastics.
Final assembly is achieved by using mechanical fasteners.
CONCEPT #2 - RESIN TRANSFER MOLDED WING
The design concept for the resin transfer molded (RTM) wing is shown in Figure
8. The design calls for the wing box to be fabricated in two halves. Each half
consists of one complete cover and part of the integral front and rear spars and
with integral rib caps. Consequently, this design has no mechanical fasteners
penetrating the outer surfaces.
The wing box would require large woven/stitched preforms. Close stitching
would be required to debulk the preforms sufficiently to allow them to be assembled
in the RTM tool. Assembly of the final molded halves would be accomplished by
mechanical fasteners in the spar webs and by mechanical attachment of the separately
molded rib webs. Figure 9 shows the fabrication approach.SPAR CAPIWEB

Figure 9. RTM Wing FabricationThe wing cover assemblies w i l l weigh approximately 2500 pounds. The largest
RTM assemblies fabricated today weigh about 250 pounds. This design would thus
require considerable scale-up of current technology.
A major concern with this design is the large number of tool parts which would
be required. Stiffeners are usually normal to the skin, thus giving closed angles
which would require segmented tools between each adjacent pair of stiffeners. A t
various locations along the wing span and probably chordwise, sets of vents would be
required for resin to escape and to release trapped air. These vents would be
closed progressively as the resin migrates outward from the injection ports. After
all vents are closed some pressure would be maintained via the injection port to
reduce the chance of entrapped air settling and causing voids.
CONCEPT /I3 - ADVANCED TOW PLACEMENT WING
The design concept for the advanced tow placement (ATP) wing is shown in
Figure 10. This design calls for the wing box to be tow placed and cured on a
single mandrel. The large size of the wing box, however, made the handling of a
single mandrel a major logistical problem. Consequently, the design was modified to
fabricate the covers and spars separately. Rectangular tubes would be tape wound on
mandrels and cut into two channel sections to form the blade stiffeners. This
process allows plies to be picked up and dropped off to add localized reinforcements
and 0 degree plies in the stiffener webs.
Spars can be tow placed in pairs around mandrels. An alternative approach
would be to incorporate the spar caps in the covers and to tow place the webs in
groups. The fabrication approach is shown in Figure 11.
The ribs would be press or diaphragm formed.
CONCEPT /I4 - BRAIDED WING
The design concept for the braided wing is shown in Figure 12. This design
calls for a one-piece wing box. Both 2D and 30 braiding were considered. The
physical size of the wing box being considered does not f i t within the confines of
any current or planned braider. Today's largest 2D braider would have difficulty
braiding 45-degree angles with 12k tow over a one-foot diameter mandrel. The size
of carrier for this type of braider is five feet in diameter. A machine capable of
braiding an L-1011 size wing box would require an enormous amount of floor and air
space. More importantly, the individual carriers could not dispense a high enough
quantity of fiber to make the process automatable. The carriers would require such
frequent replacement that the process is not feasible in the foreseeable future.
This is also partly true for 3D braiding. The limitations of closed section
tubular structures is less severe. Atlantic Research has developed an automated 3D
braider which utilizes 9216 fiber carriers. A fabrication approach is shown in
Figure 13.
Because of the problems in fabricating a complete wing box, this concept was
dropped from further consideration. The braiding process was retained as an option
for smaller assemblies as part of the modular wing box concept.INTEGRAL

Three fuselage concepts were selected for the trade studies. Concept /I1 is a
sandwich design incorporating braided triangular tubes in the sandwich. Concept {I2
is a geodesic design based on an isogrid concept. Concept {/3 is a hat stiffened
shell design.
CONCEPT /I1 - SANDWICH STIFFENED SHELL
The design concept for the sandwich shell is shown in Figure 14. This design
consists of a sandwich using braided triangular tubes as the core. The tubes are
oriented longitudinally. Periodically, there are flanged tubes as shown in Figure
15 which act as longerons.
The fabrication approach is to braid the tubes using dry fiber, then to
pultrude through a resin bath and B stage. A fly-away foam mandrel would be
required with this approach. The tubes can be fully cured and then assembled using
an adhesive. This would eliminate the need for foam mandrels but would create many
bond lines which would be difficult to inspect.
The inner skin is built up from C-sections which could also be pultruded. The
outer skin is formed by overwrapping with tow or tape. The fabrication plan for a
complete barrel section is shown in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Sandwich Fuselage FabricationCONCEPT 112 - GEODESIC FUSELAGE
The design concept for the geodesic fuselage is shown in Figure 17. This
design calls for an isogrid stiffened shell. The helical stiffeners are formed by
winding Filcoat material alternately in each direction. Filcoat is a patented
Lockheed designed material consisting of Gr/Ep tape coated with an equal thickness
of epoxy filled with glass micro-balloons called syntactic. At intersections the
syntactic is squeezed out. Figure 18 shows a schematic of an intersection. The
fibers in each direction are continuous and the intersections are the same height as
the stiffeners.
The hoop stiffeners are not continuous. They are pull-formed and cut to their
individual lengths. Intersection clips and overwraps are stitched dry fiber forms
containing mainly 245 degree and 90 degree plies to provide shear and flange bending
strength. These clips and overwraps can be combined to minimize parts and are resin
transfer molded and B-staged.
The skin is finally tape or tow wrapped over a mandrel. The fabrication
process is shown in Figure 19.
CONCEPT 113 - HAT STIFFENED SHELL FUSELAGE
The design concept for the hat stiffened shell fuselage is shown in Figure 20.
This design consists of pultruded hat stiffeners cocured to an advance tow placed
skin. The frames are designed to be resin infusion molded and the complete assembly
is cocured. An alternative fabrication method for the stiffeners is to braid prior
to pultrusion. The fabrication process is illustrated in Figure 21.

Figure 21. Stiffened Shell Fuselage FabricationThe most effective way to fabricate these panels is as quarter panels.
Essentially, upper, lower and side panels would be required. The use of closed hat
stiffeners in the lower, or keel section, needs to be studied further because of
problems associated with entrapment of bilge fluids. This is not considered to be a
major problem as composites do not corrode. Drainage must, however, be provided to
prevent accumulation of fluids and bacteria growth as well as the additional weight.
TRADE STUDIES
Figure 22 shows a summary of the options which were considered during the trade
studies.
Blade, Jay and hat stiffeners were considered as options for wing skin
stiffening. The Jay stiffener was eliminated because it is more difficult to
fabricate than the blade and it did not show a significant enough weight saving to
justify a higher cost. Hat stiffeners posed several problems in fuel tanks. They
can trap fuel, they can provide leak paths and, being wide, they are difficult to
terminate outboard effectively. This led to the use of blade stiffeners in a l l of
the wing concepts. The blade configurations are, however, different. The blade
configurations for the three concepts which were carried to completion are shown in
Figure 23. The ATP stiffeners are built up from side by side channel sections. For
the modular wing the stiffeners are pultruded with tapered flanges so that they can
be buried in the skin. For the RTM wing the stiffeners are built up from woven
stitched fabric.
The fuselage concepts are unique in themselves, so the stiffener configuration
was not tradeable.

The fabrication methods looked at for each concept are summarized in Figure 22.
The method selected for each component has already been discussed.
The trade study also looked at the possible use of thermoplastic materials
instead of thermosets. The high cost of thermoplastic materials today makes their
use in subsonic aircraft unlikely. The inherent toughness of the thermoplastic
materials has some advantages, but the toughened thermosets are much more cost
effective. Thermoplastics do look good for press formed ribs and even for frames.
The main disadvantage of mixing materials is that mechanical fasteners would be
required for assembly as thermosets and thermoplastics are very difficult to bond
together. Figure 24 shows typical thermoplastic material costs today. Figure 25
shows a comparison of current and projected material costs. If projected prices do
in fact become reality, then thermoplastics may be viable candidates for future
commercial subsonic transports.
CONCEPT EVALUATION
Each concept was evaluated for cost, weight, design technology advancement,
manufacturing technology advancement, producibility, damage tolerance, inspectabil-
ity, maintainability and repair. The ability of the concept to meet the program
goals was a major consideration. The scoring system used in the evaluation gave 40
points to cost, 30 points to weight and 30 points to all other factors. The cost
score is the cost goal divided by the concept cost multiplied by 40. The weight.
score is the weight goal divided by the concept weight multiplied by 30. The other
factors' score is the total of all points other than cost and weight divided by the
maximum possible score multiplied by 30. This is summarized in Figure 26. The
individual scores for the other factors are shown in the appendix along with the
rationale.3

WEIGHT TRADES
The weights for the wing concepts were based on the total weight of the wing
box structure per aircraft. Optimum sizing of the structure at outer wing station
151.1 was obtained. A spanwise variation was then used based on previous wing
studies. Additional weight was added to account for landing gear attach fittings,
engine mount fittings and access doors.
Weights for the fuselage concepts were based on sizing of the upper shell at
station 750. The sizing assumed maximum tension and shear or maximum compression
and shear. The sizing was then conservatively assumed to be constant at all circum-
ferential locations. Total weight between Fuselage Stations 235 and 983 was taken.
A comparison of wing box weights is shown in Figure 27 and the fuselage segment
weights in Figure 28. A summary of the weight trade study is shown in Figure 29.
COST TRADES
The cost trades were based on recurring costs only, although nonrecurring costs
were considered in the producibility trades. Recurring costs were based on a
production run of 300 ship sets at a rate of five per month. Labor rates are 1995
projected as agreed among the ACT program contractors at the Cost Workshops.
Material costs were assumed to be $40/lb. A sensitivity study on material cost will
be performed. It was assumed that there would be no purchase of facilities or
equipment. The fly to buy was dependent on fabrication method. The cost analysis
program used was ACCEM. It includes material burden, support labor, quality
control, learning curves and industrial engineering standards. A comparison of the
wing concept costs is shown in Figure 30 and a comparison of the fuselage costs is
shown in Figure 31. The cost trade study results are summarized in Figure 32.COVERS

DOWNSELECT
Based on the trade studies, one wing and one fuselage concept was selectec from
the concepts shown in Figures 34 and 35. Figure 36 shows a summary of the rankings
of the concepts. The Advanced Tow Placement Wing and the Hat Stiffened Shell
Fuselage designs finished the clear winners. Both came close to the 25 percent cost
saving target and the 40 percent weight saving target and exceeded the 50 percent
reduction in parts count. The weight saving goal shown has been reduced to 34
percent to account for resizing. The 34 percent was an overall goal bearing in mind
the fact that the wing would be expected t o have a larger savings from resizing than
would the fuselage which has volume constraints. The selected concepts are shown in
Figures 37 and 38.
The original program plan had called for continuing with a backup design for
both the wing and the fuselage through the end of Phase 1. The primary concepts,
however, emerged as such clear winners that it was decided to put a l l the remaining
effort into developing and validating the primary concepts.
EXPECTATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT
Both the selected concepts depend on minimization of mechanical fasteners and
the fabrication of large components. The development of these concepts depends on
the minimization of discontinuities, the development of analytical methods, the
demonstration of repeatable process and the use of in-process controls which will in

moderate risk but can be approached in an incremental manner which will improve the
chances of success. Neither concept involves an all or nothing approach and altern-
ative paths are available if needed.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Advanced structural and material trade studies were carried out on four wing
and three fuselage concepts. The trade studies showed that the Advanced Tow
Placement Wing concept and the Hat Stiffened Shell Fuselage concept both showed
excellent potential for meeting the program goals. The weight savings are close
enough to the goal that there is a reasonable chance of meeting or exceeding this
goal with further development and refinement. The wing cost is within one percent
of the goal and the cost of the fuselage concept exceeds the goal. Efforts are now
underway to validate these designs by more detailed analyses and by fabrication and
test.APPENDIX

RTM 6 THIS COFJCEPT IS HIGH RISK. BUT I-IAS HIGH PAY-OFF. ALSO, HAS SAME
WING ACCESS PROBLEMS AS THE MODULAR DESIGN.
ATP CONCEPT HAS LESS RISK THAN RTM DESIGN, AND ALSO LESS PAY-OFF.
WING 6 SAME ACCESS PROBLEMS AS OTHER WING CONCEPTS.
TOO MANY PIECES. THE LENGTH AND SMALL CROSS SECTION OF THE
SANDWICH
TRIANGLES MAKE MANDREL REMOVAL DIFFICULT. INSPECTION OF BONDED
FUSELAGE 3
ASSEMBLY PRESENTS PROBLEMS.
GEODESIC TOO MANY PARTS. JUNCTIOFI CLIPS VERY DIFFICULT TO FA0 WITH
FUSELAGE 3 CONTINUOUS FIBER COMPOSITES. VERY COMPLEX TOOLING, MANY PARTS.
STIFFENED SHELL ALL PROCESSES ARE AUTOMATED INCLUDING RTM. PULTRUSION AND

FUSELAGE FILAMENT WINDING.
DURABILITY 1
CONCEPT DAMAGE RATIONALE
TOLERANCE
IJODULAR 3 CONCERN IS THAT IMPACT DAMAGE WILL CAUSE STIFFENER TO PULL
WING AWAY FROM SKIN DRASTICALLY REDUCING MECHANICAL PROPERTIES.
THROUGH THE THICKNESS REINFORCEMENTS HOULD PREVENT STIFFENER
RTM 7
UNBOND AND MINIMIZE IMPACT DAMAGE. LOWER FIBER VOLUME IS STILL
WlNG
A CONCERN, AS IT WOULD REDUCE STRLJCTURAL INTEGRITY.
ATP
5 THIS IS TYPICAL OF CURRENT STRUCTURES.
WlNG
THINNESS OF FACINGS IS A DURABILIR CONCERN. IMPACT COULD CAUSE
SANDWICH
FUSELAGE 3 SEPERATION OF TRIANGULAR TUBES OVER A LARGE REGION. THlS COULD
REDUCE RESIDUAL PROPERTIES.
THlS CONFIGURATION IS HIGHLY REDUNDANT AND SHOULD HAVE OUT-
GEOOESiC 9 STANDING DURABILITY AND DAMAGE TOLERANCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A
FUSELAGE HIGH RISK OF CRITICAL MANUFACTURING FLAWS IN THE DIAGONAL
CROSS-OVERS.

STIFFENED SHELL CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN CURRENT STRUCTURES BECAUSE OF
