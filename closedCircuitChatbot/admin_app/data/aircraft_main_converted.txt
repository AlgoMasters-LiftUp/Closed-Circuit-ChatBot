aluminum ballistic FB penetration on FC with thicknesses of 5, 4, 3, and 2 mm at 255 m/s, a FEM
ballistic model was developed using the ABAQUS/Explicit modeling system. It was found that
during working conditions, none of these FBs could pierce the FC, regardless of thickness. PEEK
might be a better alternative, though, as the FC was more obviously deformed by the metal FB.
The decision was made to conduct additional analytical validation of the developed FE models.
The moment of inertia methodology, a novel approach, was employed. There was a strong cor-
relation between the results of the FE models and the analytical answers. Therefore, it may be said
that PEEK is a better material than aluminum for making blade casings.
1. Introduction
Somewhere in the world, a fan blade (FB) of an aircraft turbine engine will fail every few years [1–4]. If the engine FB of an airplane
is not contained inside the fan casing (FC) when this failure happens, the unlikely but catastrophic outcome would happen. As a result,
the aircraft’s FC needs to be able to stop damage from a failed FB. An aircraft malfunction that puts the lives of the passengers at danger
of death could result from the impact of an uncontained failed FB on an aircraft turbine engine. Therefore, it is critical to continue
researching and improving the field of FB containment [1,5].
According to the literature that was available, a superior turbine FC structure to avoid failed FB penetration was obtained by

researching the behavior of various metallic materials and metal matrix composites. Additionally, these studies considered ways to
reduce weight of the aircraft, which is essential for cost savings and for improved flight performance. For their investigations and
assessments of FB confinement, the other researchers solely used metallic materials in the fan blades (FBs) they used. Therefore, their
results confirmed the idea that the metallic FBs either penetrated the FC or result in a dent that has an impact on surrounding FBs and
other parts both inside and outside the FC [6].
The containment of an FB that has failed from the rotor hub is reportedly one of the most difficult procedures in aviation engi-
neering since it operates at high speeds and high energies, If the FB is not contained and fails or suffers secondary event damage, the
proper operation of numerous engine components, such as the other FBs, the containment structure, surrounding fan casings (FCs),
bearings, bearing supports, shafts, vanes, and externally mounted components, becomes compromised [7]. When a failed FB detaches
from its hub and is not contained, such as when an aircraft malfunctions or an engine shuts down, it immediately causes secondary
event damage. The majority of the time, the FB penetrates the FC, damaging the aircraft body structure. The containment structure,
rotor, compressor, internal frames, inlet, and FC rub strips are all affected in various instances when the FB develops sharp edges and
malfunctions [8].
Records going back decades have shown that secondary events brought on by uncontained engine failure, which has the unex-
pected effect of diminishing engine power, are the primary cause of the majority of aviation accidents. To prevent uncontained engine
failure, numerous efforts must be made to develop dependable and efficient containment structures [9]. It is significant that there are
no studies on polymer FBs in open-source literature. Studying the literature at hand revealed that no research has been done so far to
examine the ballistic impact of a detached polymer FB on the turbine FC. A test would also be prohibitively expensive, hence it is
important to perform an efficient computer analysis to mimic a polymer fan-blade out situation [10].
With the purpose of examining numerically the ballistic effect of a detached FB on its FC and the damage progression events that
occur when the FB breaks, this study aims to investigate the utilization of metallic and non-metallic (polymer) FB materials. In-
vestigations were done into the effects of changing the FC’s dimension. The effect of aluminum and Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) FBs
on a turbine FC with different thicknesses is evaluated in this study. The aviation sector may benefit from this study’s recommendation
of an alternate FB material for FB containment, which might increase aircraft safety and lighten weight.
2. Methodology
The methodology entails creating a quantitative numerical model to determine the FB’s ballistic penetration on the FC. This was
performed in ABAQUS/CAE 2017 by simulating a simple model design scenario for proprietary reasons and to make future experi-
mental setup simple. The impacts that the two different FB materials (i.e. Aluminium and PEEK) received were taken into account
when calculating the kinetic energy of each detached FB. Modeling the results of the FC being impacted by the two different FB
materials was done using the Johnson-Cook damage approach. A recently created innovative methodology called the moment of
inertia (MI) methodology was utilized to analytically validate the finite elements method (FEM) model [11]. Map forward: Mathe-
matical modeling, Numerical Modelling, Analytical validation technique: moment of inertia methodology.
This study did not consider the following: aerospace atmospheric forces, the fatigue failure of the blade, coriolis and gyroscopic
forces (These forces are critical for consideration only when the blade is attached to the rotor hub and such a scenario was not
considered in this study), the vibration of the rotor, casing or other blades and simulating destruction processes.
2.1. Mathematical modeling
In order to investigate the ballistic impact of the released blade on the engine casing, relevant mathematical models were used to
characterize the transient dynamic behavior of the FB. This includes the FB Impact Velocity, Impact energies and stresses on the engine

2.1.1. FB impact velocity
The study made the premise that the FB’s trajectory is linear because of the small amount of distance (i.e. 1 mm) over which an FB
travels. Fig. 1 depicts the FB that has been separated moving as expected.
x is ignored in this analysis due to the FB projectile’s (i.e. 1 mm) short distance before hitting the FC. Eqs. (1)–(3)’s descriptions of
Newton’s laws were used to calculate the ballistic trajectory impact [13]. In Eqn (1): N represents its rotational speed and ω its angular
velocity. Eq. (2) depicts the turbine’s linear velocity in which initial linear velocity of the FB is taken to be zero, while Vf is the final
linear velocity and rb1 is the distance from the hub turbine’s center to the outer half of the FB. The projectile time t can be defined as the
time it takes for the detached FB to touch the FC. x is the tip clearance or distance traveled by the detached FB (from launch to impact
on the FC).

2.1.2. Impact energies and stresses on the engine casing
A sensitivity analysis was conducted in this work, which examined various FB materials and FC thickness changes. The mass and
speed of the separated FB, as given in Eq. (4), define the impact energy:
1
K= 2mV2 f (4)
Where m is the mass of the FBs, K is the total kinetic energy prior to impact, and Vf is the previously determined linear impact velocity
(Eq. (2)). Kinetic energy is the primary factor in fragmentation [14]. In this work, two different ductile materials—aluminum and
PEEK—are looked into as viable FB materials. The highest bending forces and deflection at the site of impact were thus the study’s
focus points. Fig. 2 depicts a schematic of the actual FB and FC configuration. According to Sharma et al.’s [15] research of this impact
issue, shape change or dimensional instability is the factor that influences penetration. Hence, the focus of the study for the bending

I represents the Moment of Inertia in Equation (5), along with the letters b for the FBs breath and h for the FC plate’s thickness. Eq.
(6) establishes the static stress at the FC’s point of impact, according to Moon et al. [16]. Where t denotes the impact simulation time, F
denotes the impact force, L denotes the FC’s length, and s denotes the static stress impact at the center. The appropriate FC plate
thickness was determined using the maximum deflection of FC after contact based on Eq. (7) [13,16]. The maximum stress placed on
the FC after impact was determined using Eq. (8) (Moon et al. [16]). Eq. (9) [7] is used to determine how much energy the FC stored
due to deformation after impacted. Eq. (10) is used to determine the moment (M).The force of the FB’s impact on the FC is determined
with Eq. (11), where FBs mass and acceleration are denoted by m and a, respectively.

2.1.3. Failure Modes of the released FB
The detached FB is released with a specific kinetic energy when the stress surpasses the ultimate tensile strength of the FB material
[14,17]. In this investigation, it was assumed that the FB material was ductile and that it would plug when the critical impact velocity
was reached [18].
2.1.4. Critical Velocity for Plate Perforation
The speed at which the FB pierces the FC with great force is known as the critical projectile velocity [19] and is represented
mathematically by Eq. (12). Vx is the minimum perforation velocity and mp is the plug mass.

2.1.5. Johnson-Cook Damage Model
Impact research is best solved by the Johnson-Cook (J-C) model, which has the benefit of being able to distinguish between the
three essential elements of stress, strain hardening, and temperature [20]. Furthermore, for assessments of the current issue, the
Johnson-Cook model was selected as a more suitable damage model [21]. There is a stress threshold for each material that determines
when it will completely fail or keep withstanding loads without leading to a corresponding rise in strain [22]. The model is suitable to
evaluate FB confinement research and has been shown experimentally to be viable for strain rates up to and about 104 s(cid:0) 1 [21]. For
this analysis, a strain rate of 102 s(cid:0) 1 was used, which is within the allowed range [21]. The J-C model is expressed in Eq. (13) and σ e is
the von Mises flow stress, A, B, C, n and m are considered to be material constants and εp is the equivalent plastic strain given in Eq.
(14). Where ε* is the dimensionless strain rate and ε 0 =1s1. The homologous temperature T* is expressed in Eq. (15). T is the absolute
temperature, To is the room temperature, and Tm is the melting temperature of the material. T temperature rises at the plastic work
region; the heat produced by plastic work at the impact zone is considered to be adiabatic and is stated in Eq. (18) [23]. The J-C
damage model is conditioned by damage evolution. The damage D of a material is expressed in Eq. (16). The fracture strain εf is
expressed in Eq. (17). β is the fraction of plastic work converted, σ s bending stress and σ contact stress.

2.2. Numerical Modelling
The strategies and design techniques used to model the impact interaction between the different materials under evaluation and the
FB confinement are described in detail, along with the steps taken to create the finite element analysis (FEA) and the method by which
the FB and FC were simulated in order to develop the appropriate analytical input files.
2.2.1. Model development
To simplify the FB model, a rectangular shape with the following dimensions was used: 22 mm for width, 37 mm for length, and 2
mm for thickness (Fig. 3). The dimensions of a small aircraft engine utilized in the industry were used to build the FB containment
assembly. The ABAQUS CAE 2017 FEA program was used to construct the model.
2.2.2. Material properties
PEEK 1000 and aluminum 6082-T651 were selected as the FB materials in this study, whereas aluminum 6082-T651 was selected as
the FC material [24]. For this experiment, the materials were deemed to be homogeneous and isotropic. The material properties for
PEEK (Garcia-Gonzalez, Rusinek, Jankowiak, and Arias [26]) and aluminum (Boldyrev, Shchurov, and Nikonov [25]) are displayed in
Table 1 through 4. According to He et al. [27], the J-C constitutive relation is a suitable method for this specific engineering problem,
especially when there are many FB materials and different FC thicknesses. Tables 2 and 3 display the J-C constants and damage
constants for PEEK and aluminum, respectively. It is assumed that the high velocity impact of the FB onto the FC is adiabatic because
the heat generated by the plastic work at the impact location does not have enough time to be transferred to the surrounding material.
Table 4 lists the adiabatic properties of PEEK and aluminum. Aerodynamic forces were thought to have little effect on the analysis, but
it was found that the aircraft turbine could operate up to 32 500 feet, or 9.75 km, above the ground [24].
2.2.3. Assembly module
The assembly module is controlled by the formulas. In this step, the various parts that were generated are combined into a single
unit. In the assembly module, the components are put together at certain locations. The location of the FB within the assembly affects
the analysis. The FB was thus placed in the center of the FC. An inappropriately positioned FB in the assembly will immediately change
the simulation results by increasing the discrepancy between numerical and analytical results. Boundary conditions and interactions,
including planned loading and interactions, are impacted by the assembly. In the real aircraft turbine engine design, a 1 mm gap is
permitted between the FB and FC. Consequently, the FB was shifted to the center of the FC with a design clearance of 1 mm, and the FC
was fixed for the analysis in this study. This is depicted in Fig. 4.

2.2.4. Step module
The sequence in which analyses of the generated model were carried out is displayed in the two sections of the step module.
According to the ABAQUS default setup, the first step is defined first. This step defines all relevant beginning conditions, such as loads,
interactions, boundary conditions, and predefined fields. The second stage that is developed is the dynamic explicit phase, which is
intended to mimic the effect of the FB against the FC. The minimum time interval for the dynamic step is set at 0.002 s since this is
thought to be appropriate for the study and gives enough time to determine if the FB will pierce or just bounce off. The output variables
employed for this inquiry are the strain energy, the kinetic energy, and the stress in the z direction, which contributed to the model’s
deformation. The interactions between FB and FC are influenced by each of these factors [28] "Interaction" refers to the relationship
between the surfaces, e.g., the contact between the FB and FC. Because it is the only method capable of capturing high impact
deformation during short time dynamic evaluations, an explicit contact interaction strategy was selected for this investigation.
Throughout the analysis, there is hard contact mechanical behavior because of the tremendous force with which the FB contacts the
FC. It is anticipated that when the FB hits the FC, friction will cause the surfaces it creates to become heated.
2.2.5. Mesh generation
Since mesh generation influences the FE model’s computation time and result correctness, it is an essential part of simulation. The
more simulation parts there are, the more processing power is needed to do the study. Since local meshing accelerates computation, it
is believed to be more advantageous to split the component at the location of interest and use it for other portions. Mesh controls were
used to define the element’s dimensions. Mesh refinement was carried out in the partitioned section (the place of interest) on the FC in
order to obtain more accurate results. The divided area on the FC is seen in Fig. 5 of the completed model. This work used a dynamic
explicit analysis, hence a suitable mesh was needed to accurately represent the FB impact. The selection of hexahedral element types
was based on their improved convergence, lower computational cost and time, and increased precision compared to tetrahedral el-
ements [29]. Following the guidelines and standards provided by the software, three-dimensional eight-node hexahedral elements of
type C3D8I were the main elements used. Default hourglass controls were specified in order to prevent shear locking, which could
result in fake solutions [30]. Table 5 shows the number of nodes and components in the model for each of the possible scenarios.
Because to FB’s tremendous impact, significant deformation and associated elemental distortion are expected at the impact zone.
Consequently, adaptive meshing was selected to yield accurate results and a mesh. A mesh quality check was done to evaluate the
nodes’ stability. As illustrated in Fig. 5, mesh refinement was applied to the partitioned portion.
2.2.6. Mesh convergence study
In order to shorten calculation times and generate findings that are sufficient and precise, a mesh convergence research is carried
out [31]. The mesh seed size is halved after every analysis to increase the number of elements until convergence is achieved. Table 6
above displays the mesh convergence study for the 5 mm and 4 mm FC thickness, and Table 7 displays the mesh convergence study for
Fig. 5. Mesh refinement on the whole model: FB and FC.

the 3 mm and 2 mm FC thickness. Reducing the seed size resulted in a finer mesh that had a higher element density. The mesh
convergence analysis presented in Table 6 led to the conclusion that the optimum seed size was 1 mm, since this resulted in results with
an impact stress deviation of less than 10 % and a deflection deviation of 5 %. Consequently, a mesh size of 1 mm was selected for this
investigation. Based on the mesh convergence study shown in Tables 7 and it was determined that the seed size of 1 mm was
dependable when the deflection and impact percentage errors were both less than 10 %. As a result, a 1 mm mesh size was selected.
2.2.7. Boundary conditions
In order to imitate the FB containment’s operational restrictions, the model’s boundary conditions were set. The model was given
displacement and rotation as boundary conditions [28]. There are not many restrictions at the entry and exit of the FC, which is
essentially cylindrical. Since the impact happens at a specific location (the section under investigation), the boundary conditions in this
study were predicated on the existence of a beam-like restriction. The following restrictions apply to the simplified FC in Fig. 6. Since
the impact takes place in the center of the FC, which is split into four equal sections, it was expected that the left and right sides would
be fixed in a manner akin to a building beam. As a result, the rotation in the x, y, and z axes as well as the displacements on the left and
right sides of the FC are equal to zero. The top and bottom of the FC were permitted to distort as a result of the impact load produced by
the FB. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the FC’s top and bottom were only allowed to deform in the z-direction and were not allowed to move or
rotate in the x- or y-directions, respectively. The boundary conditions are unrestricted because it is assumed that the FB and hub have
been split apart.
2.2.8. Predefined field
The preset field dictates the kind of analysis the model conducts. Aerodynamic forces were assumed to have no effect on the FB
confinement. However, adiabatic effects were considered because the objective of this analysis was to determine the FC’s deformation
features that were impacted by different FB materials [8]. The velocity in the z-direction, which was fixed at 255 m/s, was obtained
using Eq. (2). Jamison, Snedden, and Turner [24] reported that as a result, the FB struck the FC at a speed of 255 m/s. Table 8 displays
the cases this study looked at.
2.3. Definition of outputs
2.3.1. Field outputs
The field outputs that were needed for this analysis were the components of stress, displacement, strain, and contact forces and
responses.
2.3.2. History outputs
The history outcomes of kinetic energy, strain energy, plastic dissipation, and damage dissipation were selected for this study. Fig. 7

2.4.1. Developed analytical validation technique
As alluded to earlier, the MI methodology was created to validate the formulated numerical model. Utilizing the newly developed
MI approach, the stress, deflection, and strain energy of the eight modeling case scenarios—FC thicknesses of 5, 4, 3, and 2 mm struck
by FBs made of aluminum 6082-T651 and PEEK 1000—were validated. Inertia of the swing of a baseball bat was examined by Koenig
et al. [32] and their research showed that when swinging a bat to hit a baseball to score, the MI and the mass of the bat are two

important factors to consider. Sharma et al. [15] studied the ballistic impact of three different metals with a target-to-projectile
thickness ratio of 1:0.5. They noticed that none of the metal bullets penetrated the plate target below a speed of 700 m/s, but that
when the projectile hit the plate, it bulged and took on a different shape. The MI methodology was created using the combined ap-
proaches of Sharma et al. [15] and Koenig et al. [32]. In this study, FC to FB ratios of 2.5:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, and 1:1 were considered. The
projectile’s change in shape was also taken into account. According to the experiments in the Sharma et al. [15] study, the sphere
projectile’s diameter rose from 10 mm to 14 mm after impact.
2.4.2. The assumptions for the development of the MI methodology
The following are the assumptions used to establish the moment of inertia methodology.
• The projectile’s mass and material properties would remain unchanged after the collision, only its MI would be affected by its
altered shape.

Fig. 7. overview of the approach utilized in the numerical model’s development and analysis.
• The rectangular projectile’s width would decrease after impact or impact the casing at various increments of the FB width during
impact.
• The projectile’s MI would vary with each increment of form change.
• It was assumed that the surface of the projectile that makes contact with the target changes shape, and that the impact zone of the
target would deform in the shape of the projectile, implying that the thickness of the target is a key factor in the change of the MI.
The focus of this study’s investigation on the FC (which came in a variety of thicknesses) was the breadth of the FB. The MI was used
as the mean variable to determine the deflection, maximum stress, and strain energy at the point of impact. The FB impacts the FC at a
linear speed of 255 m/s (as the distance considered is very short, i.e. 1 mm). Modeled as a straightforward rectangle plate with
measurements of 32 mm by 22 mm by 2 mm, the FC was square in shape and was 100 mm by 100 mm. Although the mass and speed
remained constant, the computer model showed that the FB bulges after impact, changing its shape. Indicating a phenomenon of
change at the MI during contact on the FC, the FC took on the shape of the FB at the point of impact. As shown in Fig. 8, the blade’s
shape changes the breadth or height after impact, which changes the magnitude of the MI for the FC. Eq. (5) can be used to calculate

the MI. The impact force of the FB on the FC is proportional to the width of the FB. Since the blade’s shape changes, this analysis
assumes that just its breadth does, with all other factors remaining unchanged.
2.4.3. Illustration and validation of simulations using the MI methodology
In this investigation, the impact FB’s original width is taken and decreased from 22 mm to 1 mm by 1 mm. The height variable in
Eq. (5) denotes the thickness of the FC, which ranged from 5 mm to 2 mm. The MI in m4 for various FC thicknesses and widths is shown
in Table 9.
Since all other variables depend on the MI, they could all be estimated after the MI in each range was determined. For L =100 mm,
t =0.002 s, Eq. (6) was used to compute the stress on the FC. Eq. (10) yields the force F, where F for the aluminum FB was measured at
785.4 N and F for PEEK at 280.5 N. Tables 10 and 11 give the stress from impacts with FBs made of aluminum and PEEK, respectively.
From Eq. (7), we can calculate the deflection of the FC following impact. The predicted deflection on the FC caused by the impact of
aluminum and PEEK FC is shown in Tables 12 and 13, respectively.
Tables 14 and 15, which show the strain energy on the FC affected by an aluminum FB and a PEEK FB, respectively, show the results
of calculating the strain energy of the FC after impact using Eq. (8).
3. Results
3.1. Validation of simulations using the MI methodology
The simulation results that were verified by the MI approach are presented. Analysis was done on the deflection, maximum stress,
and strain energy as well as the effects of the aluminum and PEEK FB impacting the aluminum FC. The FC under consideration ranged
in thickness from 5 mm to 4 mm–3 mm to 2 mm. The study’s main focus was on the effect the FB has on the FC after impact because
they are thrown away after the incident. It was determined that the damage to the FC was limited to a dent and that no penetration had
occurred. The degree of the FC’s deformation revealed the recommended FC thickness for use in the final FC designs. As a result, the
advice was given in an effort to prevent any secondary damaging consequences, such as compressed or damaged wires and sensors,
which could lead to an aircraft malfunction. Where the FB would penetrate the FC is indicated, by the maximum stress. Eq. (13) was
used to compute the maximum stress. MI were used for all calculations. The number of elements along the border of the FC thickness
and the size of the components in the impact zone have a significant impact on the outcome and the relationship between the
simulation and the MI methodology.
3.1.1. Stress and deflection
8 cases were investigated and the results are demonstrated in a sensitivity analysis style. 2 case scenarios of the 8 cases is
demonstrated explicitly, due to the paper’s maximum size. The simulation’s 3D visualization results, which display deflection
following impact, are shown in Figs. 9–12. Additionally, they display the maximum stress dissipation of the FC when it is impacted by
an aluminum or PEEK FB at 1 and 2 ms, respectively; these represent case scenario 1 and case scenario 2. The numbers in Tables 16 and
17 were calculated using the MI methodology.

3.2. Case scenario 1
Case scenario 1 shows the impact of an aluminum FB on a 5 mm thick FC. The simulated deflection in Fig. 9 was 1.01 mm. The
dimensional instability is shown in Table 16 to occur at a breadth of 5 mm, a MI of 5.2 x 10(cid:0) 11 m4, and a deflection of 1.11 mm. This
showed a 9 % difference in percentage between the analytical results and the simulated results. According to Table 16, the static stress
on the FC at 5.2 x 10(cid:0) 11 m4 of MI is 40 MPa. The maximum stress upon impact (280 MPa), was calculated using Eq. (14) with the static
stress value of 40 MPa. The analytically estimated stress was 280 MPa and the maximum stress of the simulation in Fig. 10 was 288.7
MPa, resulting in a 3 % inaccuracy.

3.3. Case scenario 2
Case 2 shows the impact of a PEEK FB on a 5 mm thick FC. Fig. 11. It shows that the simulation deflection was 0.41 mm, but
Table 17 demonstrates that at the breadth of 5 mm, the dimensional instability occurs and determines the MI of 5.2 x 10(cid:0) 11 m4, while
the deflection was 0.401 mm, giving an error margin of about 2 % between the simulation and analytical results. Similarly, the
maximum stress of 148 MPa was calculated using the static stress of 13 MPa found in Table 17. After impact, the simulation’s highest
stress was 137 MPa, which was 7 % higher than the theoretically predicted stress (See Fig. 12). A decrease in tension was seen as it
approached the support end. This is explained by the force and resistance of the FC at the impact location being rather insignificant.

respectively. The graphs show the same flow of dynamic penetration effects over time for both the simulation and the analytical
calculations, with case scenario 1’s dynamic impact effect becoming more stable and case scenario 2’s dynamic impact effect becoming
unstable due to polymer bounce effects on impact. At the point of impact, the strain energy was at its highest; over time, the energy
decreases. Due to the impact force being higher than that of PEEK FB, FC impact with aluminum FB stores more energy.
3.3.2. Kinetic energy
The kinetic energy behavior of the PEEK and aluminum FB is shown in Fig. 15. According to the image, the PEEK FB had a lower
pitch of kinetic energy than the aluminum FB. Therefore, it is obvious that the FC has suffered more deformation as a result of the
aluminum FB. The kinetic energy pitch of the PEEK and aluminum FBs persisted for 0.3 ms before stabilizing.

the deflection of the case scenarios upon impact. Table 19 presents the maximum stress analysis after impact for the case scenarios, and
Table 20 presents the strain energy for each of the eight case scenarios. The intention was to analyze the deflection of the FC in order to
establish the FB’s maximum deflection or penetration depth. It can be shown that none of the impacts pierced the FCs in any of the
assessments and outcomes of the case scenarios. The MI methodology and the calculation of the maximum stress and deflection
correlated well. The simulated strain energy graph and MI methodology exhibit a similar behavior for the strain energy of the case
scenarios. The case scenarios impacted with the aluminium FB produced more strain energy and more deformation with a stabilized
dynamic penetration effect in contrast to the case scenarios impacted with PEEK, which took longer to stabilize their penetration effect
but showed less FC deflection., The FB that would deform the FC more was also determined by the kinetic energy of both FBs.
4. Discussion and findings
4.1. Discussion
The number of elements on the FC’s borders and the mesh size at the impact zone both significantly affected the simulation’s
outcomes. To achieve good correlation, it was found that the thinner FC plate dimensions needed a coarse mesh size at the impact zone
and fewer elements on the sides of the edges, whereas the thicker FC plate dimensions needed a finer mesh size at the impact zone and
more elements on the sides of the edges. Fundamentally, the thickness of the FC decides whether the FB impact will enter the FC or

generate a deflection that will harm nearby wires or sensors. It was found that the deflection sharply increases after the FB to FC ratio
reaches 1:1.5, at which point the deflection exceeds the thickness of the FC. A deflection ratio of this kind can damage the sensors or
cables close to the FC. The impact is significantly influenced by the kinetic friction between the projectiles and the FC. As a result, none
of the FB that pierced the FC showed signs of the friction’s impact resistance; instead, some collisions merely caused the FC to swell.
Cases 2, 4, and 6 all had modest deflection of the 5 mm, 4 mm, and 3 mm FCs due to the PEEK FB impact. All three of the cases were
found to be eligible for blade containment since the three deflections were so slight. The deflection for case 8, a 2 mm FC that was
struck by a PEEK FB, was roughly twice as thick as the FC, preventing the FB from penetrating the FC. However, it was decided that it
was not suitable for blade confinement since it would cause additional damage to the aircraft engine.
In cases 1 and 3, the impact of the aluminum FB caused greater damage to the 5 mm and 4 mm FCs, despite the fact that the
deflection was less than the thicknesses of the FCs. This suggests that the FCs would confine the FB without causing any additional
damage. However, in cases 5 and 7, which involved FCs with thicknesses of 3 mm and 2 mm, respectively, the aluminium FB severely
damaged those FCs as a result of the extremely high deflections that it was subjected to. This suggests that taking into account the 3 mm

and 2 mm FCs would be risky. The aircraft would malfunction from this kind of damage, and the engine would probably shut off. The
visible dents indicate that the cables and sensors may have been damaged. The FB containment simulation was modeled utilizing the J-
C simulation methodology. The findings showed that the Johnson-Cook model’s plasticity behavior works mediocrely well for blade
containment issues. This was seen in the behavior of the PEEK and aluminum FBs as they affected the varied thicknesses of aluminum
FCs in the numerical simulation.
When the aluminium FB struck the FCs, these FCs underwent significant plastic deformation, but no penetration occurred in any
simulation. The impacted FCs did not undergo any appreciable plastic deformation in relation to the PEEK FB. The following obser-
vations from several cases are provided:
Cases 1 and 2 include the 5 mm casing being struck by aluminium and PEEK FBs, respectively. The results of the MI methodology
are consistent with the minor deflection that was seen on the FC from the impacts of these FBs. Both FBs were appropriate in this
situation because none of them managed to breach the 5 mm FC. Additionally, the deflection on both cases is substantially smaller than
the actual FC thicknesses. The deflections of the PEEK and aluminum FBs were, respectively, 0.41 mm and 1.01 mm. From these
findings, it was clear that the PEEK FB was better suited due to its contribution to lowering the aircraft’s overall weight, improving fuel
efficiency, and resulting cost reduction. The PEEK blade does not harm the case as severely as the aluminium blade, according to the
simulation stress findings of the impacts of both blades. Regarding cases 3 and 4, the 4 mm FC that was struck by the aforementioned
FBs deflected by 2.7 mm for the aluminium FB and by 0.578 mm for the PEEK FB. But neither of the FBs managed to enter the FC. The
cables and sensors may be compressed by the FC’s deflection brought on by the aluminum FB. This could lead to the sensors gradually
failing and the wires connecting the engine and control system malfunctioning, which could lead to an aircraft failure.
Cases 5 and 6, which had 3 mm FCs, had an aluminum FB impact deflection of 4.45 mm but no penetration. The attached sensors
would suffer immediate damage even if there was no penetration since the impact of the FB on the FC may create sharp edges that
could damage the aircraft’s body structure. On the other hand, the PEEK FB’s impact on the FC resulted in a modest 0.56 mm
deflection. Results from cases 7 and 8 showed that a 2 mm FC that had been struck by both an aluminum and a PEEK FBs deflected by
9.13 mm and 4.7 mm, respectively. In this instance, neither of the blades broke through the FC. The sensors and cables would suffer
severe damage since the impact deflections of the FBs are far greater than the thickness of the casing. This demonstrated that the post-
yield deformation of the 2 mm FC had occurred, which is outside the scope of the current investigation and is not described here. The 2
mm FC shouldn’t be employed, according to the judgment drawn in this case after observation.
The MI methodology’s findings were consistent with the deflections of all the FCs. To validate the MI methodology, the stress
simulation of the analysis on the various casing thicknesses was performed. If the stress and deflection percentage errors are both larger
than 10 %, it might be wise to conduct experiments to verify the findings. Both the projectile and the target bend when they collide, yet
the mass and material characteristics are unaltered. These shape alterations have an impact on the MI because of the plastic defor-
mation. The proposed MI methodology accurately validated the generated numerical model, with good correlations between all eight
simulated deflections and maximum stresses in both methods. The suggested moment of inertia approach takes into account the
deformation that occurs between the projectile and target during impact, which modifies the MI. Studies in the literature have
demonstrated that after an impact, the shapes of two colliding bodies change. As a result, the FC and FB’s moment of inertia were
19S. Rouxzeta VAN Der Merwe et al. H e l i y o n 1 0 (2024)e24157
changed for this investigation.
On the four various thicknesses of the casings, the strain energy exhibited dynamic behavior. According to the examination of the
FC strain energy, all of the graphs have a single plateau, which is then followed by a slow decline and a stable region. According to
Olsson, Donadon, and Falzon [33], an impactor will react energetically differently to projectiles of differing masses. The impact of
PEEK and aluminum FBs in this investigation showed that a tiny mass projectile will not have enough time to deflect and will behave
transversely from the impactor. Despite sharing the same properties, the strain energy graphs stabilized at different values. As a result,
it was shown that the dynamic effects on FCs by the PEEK FB are unstable and take some time to stabilize. The time at which the
deformation occurs is indicated by the plateau. After then, the strain energy steadily drops and stabilizes, leading to a no penetration
event at 255 m/s in velocity. The strain energy graphs produced by the numerical model and those produced by the MI methodology,
both demonstrated the same pattern and a very strong correlation, it is crucial to note at this point.
Findings showed that the high energy of both the aluminum and the PEEK FBs was 0.3 ms (ms), when comparing the kinetic energy
findings of the two types of FBs. The plateau seen in the graph of the aluminum FB, however, is larger than that of the PEEK FB. If the
speed were raised, the aluminum FB’s material qualities would cause a distortion that would seriously damage the FC or enter the FC.
Even if the speed is increased, the PEEK blade is less likely to penetrate since its kinetic energy is roughly one-fourth that of the
aluminum FB. Instead, it might cause the blade to shatter or the FC to deflect more. The numerical model was unable to account for all
the incidences that occurred during the experiments, according to Sharma et al. [34], who discussed the noticeable error discrepancy
between the experimental and numerical assessments. Because the MI methodology in this study is unable to account for the
temperature-related incidents that happened in the numerical model, it may be concluded that there is an error difference between the
numerical model and that methodology.
4.2. Findings
1. No penetration was seen in any of the cases, regardless of the FB material or FC thickness; nonetheless, the amount of deformation
decreased as the FC thickness increased.
2. The strain energy, maximum stress, and deflection sensitivity analysis tables all displayed the same deformation pattern.
3. Excessive plasticity was present in Cases 8, 7, 5, and 3, in that sequence.
4. Cases 2, 1, 4, and 6, in the order given, deform within the elastic zone.
5. The outcomes showed that the model’s plasticity behavior, as predicted by Johnson-Cook, is effective for solving FB containment
issues.
6. The proposed MI methodology accurately validated the constructed numerical model, and all of the deflection and maximum
stresses for the eight simulated cases closely correlated.
5. Conclusions
A new methodology MI approach was developed to account for a projectile’s ability to instantly change shape. The simulation
model and the MI methodology have a high correlation. Prior research on ballistic test experiments has proved to be expensive. Hence,
the MI methodology has shown to be a practical and affordable way to validate the numerical model. The findings led to the following.
• The MI of the case was influenced by the FB’s shape, and it influences how resistant it is to deflection.
• There was a correlation between the simulation (conducted using ABAQUS/Explicit 2017) and the MI methodology.
• The MI methodology is appropriate for ballistic collisions
Based on these findings lead it is concluded that PEEK can be utilized to make FBs because of the material’s dependability and
potential to reduce the risk of non-containment problems. In addition, PEEK material is appropriate for a 2 mm FB with a 5 mm or 4
mm FC. Another benefit is that manufacturing a PEEK FB only requires two days, compared to seven days for an aluminum FB. The
order of rank for a different range to choose the best FC would be Case 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, and 7. Using the MI methodology, additional
research on the impact of various projectile shapes can be conducted.
