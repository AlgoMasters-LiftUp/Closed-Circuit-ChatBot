Turkish Aerospace Industries Inc. (TUSAŞ) (TAI - Turkish Aerospace Industries, Inc.)
is the technology center in Turkey for the design, development, production, completion,
renewal, and post-sales services of air platforms. The company produces parts for the
world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, and the military transport aircraft,
the Airbus A400M. Additionally, the company started producing wingtips for the
Airbus A350, which made its first flight in 2013.
History and Current Status
Its origins go back to the establishment of Turkish Aircraft Industries Inc. (TUSAŞ) in 1973.
TUSAŞ was founded on June 28, 1973, within the Ministry of Industry and Technology,
aiming to reduce Turkey's dependence on foreign defense industries. On April 28, 2005,
TUSAŞ and TAI merged under the name TAI (Turkish Aerospace Industries Inc.), forming a
significant force with its design and production infrastructure and human resources, serving as
an "Aviation Center." TUSAŞ's shareholders are the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation
(TSKGV) (54.49%), the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSM) (45.45%), and the Turkish
Aeronautical Association (THK) (0.06%).
Turkish Aerospace Industries Inc. (TAI) was established on May 15, 1984, in accordance with
the Turkish Commercial Code and the Law on the Encouragement of Foreign Capital. On
January 12, 2005, through the "Share Sale Agreement" signed at the TUSAŞ facilities, shares
owned by Lockheed Martin of Turkey (42%) and General Electric International (7%) were
purchased by Turkish Aircraft Industries Inc. (TUSAŞ).
TUSAŞ facilities are established on a total area of 5,000,000 square meters, with 186,000
square meters being covered. The modern aircraft production facility, equipped with high-tech
machinery and equipment at Akıncı Air Base, has extensive production capabilities ranging
from part manufacturing to aircraft assembly, flight tests, and delivery. TUSAŞ's quality
system meets globally recognized standards such as NATO AQAP-110, ISO-9001:2000, AS
EN 9100, and AECMA-EASE.
TUSAŞ's current experience includes joint production of F-16 Fighting Falcons, CN-235 light
transport/maritime patrol/surveillance aircraft, SF-260D training aircraft, Cougar AS-532
search and rescue (SAR), combat search and rescue (CSAR), and general-purpose helicopters,
as well as development programs for indigenous products like unmanned aerial vehicles,
target drones, and agricultural spraying aircraft.
TUSAŞ's main activities include modernization, modification, and system integration
programs for military and commercial air platforms in Turkey and other countries in the
region, as well as post-sales services. These activities include electronic warfare and structural
modifications for the Turkish Air Force's F-16s, converting S-2 Tracker maritime patrol
aircraft to firefighting aircraft, modifications of CN-235 aircraft and Black Hawk Helicopters
for Special Forces, modernization of Cougar AS-532 helicopters, digital cockpit
modifications for S-70 helicopters, structural and avionic modifications of CN-235 platforms
for the Naval Forces Command and the Coast Guard, and all structural modifications and
system integration activities for converting B737-700 aircraft into Airborne Early Warning
and Control Aircraft (AEW&C).Starting with very few people in 1984, TUSAŞ has transferred its experience from military
projects to commercial projects, achieving its goal of becoming a global company today with
over 3000 qualified employees and nearly 50 different projects.
TUSAŞ, as a national industrial organization, is also a partner in Airbus Military,
participating in the design and development activities of the A400M aircraft along with
aviation companies from France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Spain, Belgium, and South Africa.
Committed to being among the leading organizations in the aviation field by closely following
the latest technological developments worldwide, TUSAŞ aims to open new horizons in
Turkey in the 21st century. According to an agreement signed with RUAG Aerospace (RA)
on November 3, 2005, TUSAŞ will produce D-Nose Panel Stretching Shells for the Airbus
A380 aircraft at its facilities in Turkey.
In recent years, TUSAŞ has started designing unique aircraft for Turkey, independent of
external sources. The first of these is the agricultural spraying aircraft TUSAŞ ZİU, entirely
designed and flown by TUSAŞ. Following this, many indigenous design projects are currently
underway. As of 2008, the Gözcü (an anti-terrorism unmanned observation aircraft), Keklik
and Turna-g (both target drones for fighter pilot training) unmanned aircraft are designed and
produced by TUSAŞ and are in the inventory of the Turkish Air Force. A new model of
Gözcü is currently being designed. Besides unmanned aerial vehicles, the design and
development of a training aircraft called HÜRKUŞ (a training aircraft with jet aircraft-like
controls but without a jet engine, offering low operating costs) have been completed, and its
mass production has begun. The development of the tactical unmanned aerial vehicle ANKA
is ongoing. The renewal of T-38 and C-130 Hercules aircraft is being carried out. The
integration of the Göktürk-1 reconnaissance and observation satellite in collaboration with
TÜBİTAK UZAY was carried out at the Space Systems Integration and Test Center (USET),
operated by TUSAŞ.
Being one of the most advanced parts of Turkish Aviation, TUSAŞ also serves as the
locomotive of the sector. As Turkey's avionics integration center, TUSAŞ continues to
increase its competitiveness in this field every day. The organization is also one of the
stakeholders of Teknofest Istanbul.
Vision and Mission
TUSAŞ's vision is to become a global brand by achieving the capability to design, produce,
and support all types of air and space vehicles.
TUSAŞ's mission is to develop technologies and capabilities, including design, to meet the
military and civil aviation and space system needs of Turkey and international customers, to
increase its market share in the global competitive environment through continuous
improvements, and to create value for its country, customers, partners, suppliers, and
employees.
